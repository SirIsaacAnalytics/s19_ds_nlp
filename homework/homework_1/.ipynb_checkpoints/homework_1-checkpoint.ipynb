    "In this homework you will be analyzing presidential debate texts. Specifically, you will be trying to identify rhetorical questions in the debate text. We will operate that a rhetorical question is a sentence that is a question, but that is not answered by another speaker. In the context of this debate text, we will assume that a rhetorical question is any that occurs within a single speaker's response. \n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, the following would be considered rhetorical for our purposes:\n",
    "    I have one last part here. I decided I was dumb and didn't understand it, so I called the \"Who's Who\" of the folks that have been around it. ==An example rhetorical question ==> And I said, \"Why won't everybody go south?\" They say, \"It would be disruptive.\"  ==An example rhetorical question ==>  I said, \"For how long?\"  ==An example rhetorical question ==>  I finally got them up for 12 to 15 years. And I said, \"Well, how does it stop being disruptive?\" And that is, when their jobs come up from $1 an hour to $6 an hour, and ours go down to $6 an hour, then it's leveled again. But in the meantime, you've wrecked the country with these kinds of deals. We've got to cut it out.\n",
    "    \n",
    "A key task here will be to iterate through all the debates and then segment the speech into sentences. Identify the sentences which are questions or contain questions. The only thing to check for is whether it is at the end of a speaker turn. \n",
    "\n",
    "For stretch goals that could count as extra credit, you can try to identify who said the rhetorical question (which would require tracking which part of the debate you are in). Also, you could try to identify what the repsonse to the question was. You could further examine the ways in which the rhetorical questions might differ from other statements."

      "Ms. Ridings. Good evening from the Kentucky Center for the Arts in Louisville, Kentucky. I'm Dorothy Ridings, president of the League of Women Voters, the sponsor of tonight's first Presidential debate between Republican Ronald Reagan and Democrat Walter Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight's debate marks the third consecutive Presidential election in which the League is presenting the candidates for the Nation's highest office in face-to-face debate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our panelists are James Wieghart, national political correspondent for Scripps-Howard News Service; Diane Sawyer, correspondent for the CBS program \"60 Minutes;\" and Fred Barnes, national political correspondent for the Baltimore Sun. Barbara Walters of ABC News, who is appearing in her fourth Presidential debate, is our moderator.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barbara.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Thank you, Dorothy.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few words as we begin tonight's debate about the format. The position of the candidates-that is, who answers questions first and who gives the last statement--was determined by a toss of a coin between the two candidates. Mr. Mondale won, and that means that he chose to give the final closing statement. It means, too, that the President will answer the first question first. I hope that's clear. If it isn't, it will become clear as the debate goes on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, the candidates will be addressed as they each wanted and will, therefore, be called \"Mr. President\" and \"Mr. Mondale.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Since there will also be a second debate between the two Presidential candidates, tonight will focus primarily on the economy and other domestic issues. The debate, itself, is built around questions from the panel. In each of its segments, a reporter will ask the candidates the same general question. Then--and this is important-each candidate will have the chance to rebut what the other has said. And the final segment of the debate will be the closing segment, and the candidates will each have 4 minutes for their closing statements. And as I have said, Mr. Mondale will be the last person on the program to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now I would like to add a personal note if I may. As Dorothy Ridings pointed out, I have been involved now in four Presidential debates, either as a moderator or as a panelist. In the past, there was no problem in selecting panelists. Tonight, however, there were to have been four panelists participating in this debate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The candidates were given a list of almost 100 qualified journalists from all the media and could agree on only these three fine journalists. As moderator, and on behalf of my fellow journalists, I very much regret, as does the League of Women Voters, that this situation has occurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now let us begin the debate with the first question from James Wieghart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wieghart.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nation's Economy\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wieghart. Mr. President, in 1980 you promised the American people--in your campaign--a balanced budget by 1983. We've now had more and bigger deficits in the 4 years you've been in office. Mr. President, do you have a secret plan to balance the budget sometime in a second term, and if so, would you lay out that plan for us tonight?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. I have a plan--not a secret plan. As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is true that earlier, working with some very prominent economists, I had come up, during the campaign, with an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us--the double-digit inflation, the high tax rates that I think were hurting the economy, the stagflation that we were undergoing. Before even the election day, something that none of those economists had even predicted had happened, that the economy was so worsened that I was openly saying that what we had thought on the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget--no, that was no longer possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy, recovery without inflation, and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product, which has become a drag on the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Already, we have a recovery that has been going on for about 21 months to the point that we can now call it an expansion. Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery. We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was. The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further. In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs--there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending--the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet. And when they meet, that is a balanced budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wieghart. Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office has some bad news. The lines aren't about to meet, according to their projections. They project that the budget deficit will continue to climb. In the year 1989 they project a budget deficit of $273 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In view of that, and in view of the economic recovery we are now enjoying, would it make sense to propose a tax increase or take some other fiscal measures to reduce that deficit now, when times are relatively good?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. The deficit is the result of excessive government spending. I do not, very frankly, take seriously the Congressional Budget Office projections, because they have been wrong on virtually all of them, including the fact that our recovery wasn't going to take place to begin with. But it has taken place.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent. If the rate of increase in government spending can be held at 5 percent-we're not far from there--by 1989 that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a $30 or $40 billion level. At the same time, if we can have a 4-percent recovery continue through that same period of time, that will mean--without an increase in tax rates--that will mean $400 billion more in government revenues. And so, I think that the lines can meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, in constant dollars, in the domestic side of the budget, there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wieghart. Mr. Mondale, the Carter-Mondale administration didn't come close to balancing the budget in its 4 years in office either, despite the fact that President Carter did promise a balanced budget during his term.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have proposed a plan combining tax increases and budgetary cuts and other changes in the administration of the Government that would reduce the projected budget deficit by two-thirds, to approximately $87 billion in 1989. That still is an enormous deficit that will be running for these 4 years. What other steps do you think should be taken to reduce this deficit and position the country for economic growth?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation. And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits.\n",
      "\n",
      "I respect the President; I respect the Presidency, and I think he knows that. But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars. As a matter of fact, over 4 years, they've missed the mark by nearly $600 billion. We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983. It was $200 billion deficit instead. And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we'll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virtually every economic analysis that I've heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit. In other words, it doesn't converge as the President suggests. It gets larger even with growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade. This is the worst trade year in American history by far. Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation. Real interest rates--the real cost of interest-will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we're moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession. I get it down to a level below 2 percent of gross national product with a policy that's fair. I've stood up and told the American people that I think it's a real problem, that it can destroy long-term economic growth, and I've told you what I think should be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think this is a test of leadership, and I think the American people know the difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wieghart. Mr. Mondale, one other way to attack the deficit is further reductions in spending. The President has submitted a number of proposals to Congress to do just that, and in many instances the House, controlled by the Democrats, has opposed them. Isn't it one aspect of leadership for prominent Democrats such as yourself to encourage responsible reductions in spending, and thereby reduce the deficit?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. Absolutely, and I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over 4 years, but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things-- [applause] --that people need. These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and I'm not going to do it that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rate of defense spending increase can be slowed. Certainly we can find a coffeepot that costs something less than $7,000. And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life. And that's why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the President's recommendations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. I would like to ask the audience please to refrain from applauding either side; it just takes away from the time for your candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now it is time for the rebuttal. Mr. President, 1 minute for rebuttal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Yes. I don't believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes. And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history took place 1977. And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion. So, there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget. Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, you're taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down government's share of what it is taking.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to Social Security, I hope there'll be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this: A President should never say \"never.\" But I'm going to violate that rule and say \"never.\" I will never stand for a reduction of the Social Security benefits to the people that are now getting them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Mr. Mondale?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. Well, that's exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits. And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent-reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying--with widows trying to get them through college. Everybody remembers that; people know what happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a difference. I have fought for Social Security and Medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life, and I will do it as President of the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Thank you very much. We'll now begin with segment number two with my colleague, Diane Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer?\n",
      "\n",
      "Leadership Qualities\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer. Mr. President, Mr. Mondale, the public opinion polls do suggest that the American people are most concerned about the personal leadership characteristics of the two candidates, and each of you has questioned the other's leadership ability. Mr. President, you have said that Mr. Mondale's leadership would take the country down the path of defeatism and despair, and Vice President Bush has called him whining and hoping for bad news. And, Mr. Mondale, you have said that President Reagan offers showmanship, not leadership, that he has not mastered what he must know to command his government.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd like to ask each of you to substantiate your claims--Mr. Mondale first. Give us specifics to support your claim that President Reagan is a showman, not a leader; has not mastered what he must know to be President after 4 years, and then, second, tell us what personal leadership characteristics you have that he does not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what I'm saying. There is no question that we face this massive deficit, and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down, the chances for long-term, healthy growth are nil. And it's also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason. No one else believes that's the case. I do, and I'm standing up to the issue with an answer that's fair. I think that's what leadership is all about. There's a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when there's a real problem, a President must confront it.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon. Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions. The first time--and I did not criticize the President, because these things can happen--once, and sometimes twice-the second time the barracks in Lebanon were assaulted, as we all remember. There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I believe that a President must command that White House and those who work for him. It's the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done. I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what's needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead. And that's why in this campaign I'm telling you exactly what I want to do. I am answering your questions. I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer. You have said, Mr. Mondale, that the polls have given you lower ratings on leadership than President Reagan because your message has failed to get through. Given that you have been in public office for so many years, what accounts for the failure of your message to get through?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr, Mondale. Well, I think we're getting better all the time. And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other. And I think, as a part of that process, what I am trying to say will come across, and that is that we must lead, we must command, we must direct, and a President must see it like it is. He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer. Mr. President, the issue is leadership in personal terms. First, do you think, as Vice President Bush said, that Mr. Mondale's campaign is one of whining and hoping for bad news? And second, what leadership characteristics do you possess that Mr. Mondale does not?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since you've asked it. And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security-before I get to the answer to your question--the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, leadership. First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in. In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society--that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, having that, I think also that in leadership--well, I believe that you find people, positions such as I'm in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government. I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court. And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job. You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I also believe something else about that. I believe that--and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office--that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue. I don't want to hear them. I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people--is it morally right? And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be abhorred--that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer. As a followup, let me draw in another specific, if I could--a specific that the Democrats have claimed about your campaign--that it is essentially based on imagery. And one specific that they allege is that, for instance, recently you showed up at the opening ceremony of a Buffalo old-age housing project, when in fact, your policy was to cut Federal housing subsidies for the elderly. Yet you were there to have your picture taken with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Our policy was not to cut subsidies. We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure. And this is what we've been trying to do, is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and we're going to continue along that line. We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need. We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need. The safety net is there, and we're taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Mr. Mondale, an opportunity for you to rebut.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. Well, I guess I'm reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover. He said, \"It's not what he doesn't know that bothers me; it's what he knows for sure that just ain't so.\" [Laughter] The fact of it is: The President's budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent. It's not an opinion; it's a fact. And when the President was asked the other day, \"What do you want to cut in the budget?\", he said, \"Cut those things I asked for but didn't get.\" That's Social Security and Medicare.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second fact is that the housing unit for senior citizens that the President dedicated in Buffalo was only made possible through a Federal assistance program for senior citizens that the President's budget sought to terminate. So, if he'd had his way, there wouldn't have been any housing project there at all. This administration has taken a meat cleaver out, in terms of Federal-assisted housing, and the record is there. We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Mr. President?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Well, let me just respond with regard to Social Security. When we took office, we discovered that the program that the Carter-Mondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of Social Security for the next 50 years wouldn't solve them for 5. Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees, who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce. And so, we made a proposal. And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign. And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke. Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks. And then I asked for a bipartisan commission, which I'd asked for from the beginning, to sit down and work out a solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Mr. President, we begin segment number three with Fred Barnes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Religion\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Barnes. Mr. President, would you describe your religious beliefs, noting particularly whether you consider yourself a born-again Christian, and explain how these beliefs affect your Presidential decisions?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since I was a small boy. In our particular church, we did not use that term, \"born again,\" so I don't know whether I would fit that--that particular term. But I have--thanks to my mother, God rest her soul--the firmest possible belief and faith in God. And I don't believe--I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not--I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others. And I do resort to prayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign--or religion a part of that campaign. As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale's running mate said I wasn't a good Christian.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, it does play a part in my life. I have no hesitancy in saying so. And, as I say, I don't believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Barnes. Given those beliefs, Mr. President, why don't you attend services regularly, either by going to church or by inviting a minister to the White House, as President Nixon used to do, or someone to Camp David, as President Carter used to do?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. The answer to your question is very simple about why I don't go to church. I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington. And now, in the position I hold and in the world in which we live, where Embassies do get blown up in Beirut--we're supposed to talk about that on the debate the 21st, I understand--but I pose a threat to several hundred people if I go to church.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know the threats that are made against me. We all know the possibility of terrorism. We have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the White House. And, therefore, I don't feel--and my minister knows this and supports me in this position--I don't feel that I have a right to go to church, knowing that my being there could cause something of the kind that we have seen in other places, in Beirut, for example. And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands. [Applause]\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. May I ask you, please-- [applause] --may I ask the audience please to refrain from applause.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred, your second question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Barnes. Mr. Mondale, would you describe your religious beliefs and mention whether you consider yourself a born-again Christian, and explain how those beliefs would affect your decisions as President?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. First of all, I accept President Reagan's affirmation of faith. I'm sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a son of a Methodist minister. My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister. And I don't know if I've been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family. And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency. Whether that helps or not, I don't know.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a deep religious faith. Our family does. It is fundamental. It's probably the reason that I'm in politics. I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead. And I think we're all together on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "What bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use one's own personal interpretation of faith politically, to question others' faith, and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others. All history tells us that that's a mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Republican platform says that from here on out, we're going to have a religious test for judges before they're selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think that's an abuse of faith in our country.\n",
      "\n",
      "This nation is the most religious nation on Earth--more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth-and it's because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith. That's why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians. And I think if we want to continue--as I do--to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Thank you. Mr. Barnes, next question. We have time for rebuttal now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Barnes. I think I have a followup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Yes, I asked you if you did. I'm sorry.--\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Barnes. Yes, I do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. --I thought you waived it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Barnes. Yes, Mr. Mondale, you've complained, just now, about Jerry Falwell, and you've complained other times about other fundamentalists in politics. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't recall your ever complaining about ministers who are involved in the civil rights movement or in the anti-Vietnam war demonstrations or about black preachers who've been so involved in American politics. Is it only conservative ministers that you object to?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale, No. What I object to-- [applause] --what I object to--what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others.\n",
      "\n",
      "A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire. The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people, hopefully, I accept and rejoice in. It's when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political--or private religious faith and the use of the state is where--for the most personal decisions in American life--that's where I draw the line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Thank you. Now, Mr. President, rebuttal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Yes, it's very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale. I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there. The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion. And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion. A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can't do it because it's school property. These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that. I have appointed one member to the Supreme Court: Sandra Day O'Connor. I'll stand on my record on that. And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I'll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Mr. Mondale, your rebuttal, please.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. The platform to which the President refers, in fact, calls for a religious test in the selection of judges. And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges. And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's take the example that the President cites. I believe in prayer. My family prays. We've never had any difficulty finding time to pray. But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves? Who would write the prayer? What would it say? How would it be resolved when those disputes occur?\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems to me that a moment's reflection tells you why the United States Senate turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it. We don't want that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Thank you, Mr. Mondale. Our time is up for this round.\n",
      "\n",
      "We go into the second round of our questioning, begin again with Jim Wieghart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim?\n",
      "\n",
      "Political Issues\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wieghart. After that discussion, this may be like going from the sublime to the ridiculous, but here goes. I have a political question for you, Mr. Mondale. [Laughter]\n",
      "\n",
      "Polls indicate a massive change in the electorate, away from the coalition that has long made the Democratic Party a majority. Blue-collar workers, young professionals, their children, and much of the middle class now regard themselves as Independents or Republican instead of Democrats, and the gap--the edge the Democrats had in party registration seems to be narrowing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd like to ask you, Mr. Mondale, what is causing this? Is the Democratic Party out of sync with the majority of Americans? And will it soon be replaced as the majority party by the Republicans? What do you think needs to be done about it, as a Democrat?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. My answer is that this campaign isn't over yet. And when people vote, I think you're going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that I'm talking about.\n",
      "\n",
      "The American people want arms control. They don't want this arms race. And they don't want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens. And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world.\n",
      "\n",
      "The American people see this debt, and they know it's got to come down. And if it won't come down, the economy's going to slow down, maybe go into a recession. They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history. And they know this debt must come down as well, because it's unfair to our children.\n",
      "\n",
      "The American people want this environment protected. They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that people's lives and health are being risked, because we've had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The American people want their children educated. They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that's widening between the United States and Europe and Japan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The American people want to keep opening doors. They want those civil rights laws enforced. They want the equal rights amendment ratified. They want equal pay for comparable effort for women. And they want it because they've understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we're all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wieghart. Mr. Mondale, isn't it possible that the American people have heard your message--and they are listening--but they are rejecting it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit. The President says it'll disappear automatically. I've said it's going to take some work. I think the American people will draw their own conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, I've said that I will not support the cuts in Social Security and Medicare and the rest that the President has proposed. The President answers that it didn't happen or, if it did, it was resolved later in a commission. As the record develops, I think it's going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wieghart. Mr. President, you and your party are benefiting from what appears to be an erosion of the old Democratic coalition, but you have not laid out a specific agenda to take this shift beyond November 6th. What is your program for America for the next decade, with some specificity?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Well, again, I'm running on the record. I think sometimes Mr. Mondale's running away from his. But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for. We'll continue to try to get things that we didn't get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6.1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government. And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago--I know, because I was a Democrat at that time. And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people.\n",
      "\n",
      "I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation. We have, to onethird of what it was. I promised that we would reduce taxes. We did, 25 percent across the board. That barely held even with--if it did that much--with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977. But at least it took that burden away from them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did--6 million in the last 20 or 21 months. I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons. We have done that.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done. And I think this is something the American people see.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education--on excellence in education. And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems. We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth. All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn't taking us where we want to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wieghart. Mr. President, much of what you said affects the quality of life of many Americans--their income, the way they live, and so forth--but there's an aspect to quality of life that lies beyond the private sector which has to do with our neighborhoods, our cities, our streets, our parks, our environment. In those areas, I have difficulty seeing what your program is and what you feel the Federal responsibility is in these areas of the quality of life in the public sector that affects everybody, and even enormous wealth by one individual can't create the kind of environment that he might like.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well, and you've named some of them. Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down--or since we've kept records--2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we've had. I think that we've had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The environment? Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment. When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5-year program--but it's just about finished already--a billion dollars. And now we're going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks. We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges. I think that we're out in front of most--and I see that the red light is blinking, so I can't continue. But I've got more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Well, you'll have a chance when your rebuttal time comes up, perhaps,\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President. Mr. Mondale, now it's your turn for rebuttal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. The President says that when the Democratic Party made its turn, he left it. The year that he decided we had lost our way was the year that John F. Kennedy was running against Richard Nixon. I was chairman of \"Minnesotans for Kennedy;\" President Reagan was chairman of a thing called \"Democrats for Nixon.\" Now, maybe we made a wrong turn with Kennedy, but I'll be proud of supporting him all of my life. And I'm very happy that John Kennedy was elected, because John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President just said that his government is shrinking. It's not. It's now the largest peacetime government ever in terms of the take from the total economy. And instead of retreating.--instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life. That's where government should not be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Mr. President?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States. And so, my change had come earlier than that. I hadn't gotten around to reregistering as yet. I found that was rather difficult to do. But I finally did it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some other things that have been said here--back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up. Mr. Mondale referred to the farmers' worst year. The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done. The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 21 1/2-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier. All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers. As a matter of fact, there has been less than one-quarter of i percent of foreclosures of the 270,000 loans from government that the farmers have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Thank you, Mr. President. We'll now turn to Diane Sawyer for her round of questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diane?\n",
      "\n",
      "Abortion\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer. I'd like to turn to an area that I think few people enjoy discussing, but that we probably should tonight because the positions of the two candidates are so clearly different and lead to very different policy consequences--and that is abortion and right to life. I'm exploring for your personal views of abortion and specifically how you would want them applied as public policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, Mr. President. Do you consider abortion murder or a sin? And second, how hard would you work--what kind of priority would you give in your second term legislation to make abortion illegal? And specifically, would you make certain, as your party platform urges, that Federal justices that you appoint be pro-life?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life. Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life. But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is-there's been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government. With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it's a problem of the Constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us. And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying--I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious--there were clerics there-everyone talking about this matter of pro-life. And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive. We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life. In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor--signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder. Now, isn't it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that's murder? And it used the term \"death of the unborn child.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine--and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer. A two-part followup. Do I take it from what you've said about the platform, then, that you don't regard the language and don't regard in your own appointments, abortion position a test of any kind for justices--that it should be? And also, if abortion is made illegal, how would you want it enforced? Who would be the policing units that would investigate? And would you want the women who have abortions to be prosecuted?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. The laws regarding that always were State laws. It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy. Our laws against murder are State laws. So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I say, I feel that we have a problem here to resolve. And no one has approached it from that matter. It does not happen that the church that I belong to had that as part of its dogma. I know that some churches do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it is a sin if you're taking a human life. At the same time, in our Judeo-Christian tradition, we recognize the right of taking a human life in self-defense. And therefore, I've always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer. Mr. Mondale, to turn to you, do you consider abortion a murder or a sin? And bridging from what President Reagan said, he has written that if society doesn't know whether life does--human life, in fact, does begin at conception, as long as there is a doubt, that the unborn child should at least be given the benefit of the doubt and that there should be protection for that unborn child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated. I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest. Is it really the view of the American people, however you feel on the question of abortion, that government ought to be reaching into your living rooms and making choices like this? I think it cannot work, won't work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law. Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them. The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different. Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step. But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion. Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her. That's always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime. But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped? Do we really want those decisions made by judges who've been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty? I don't think so, and I think it's going in exactly the wrong direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "In America, on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives. We haven't felt so insecure that we've reached for the club of state to have our point of view. It's been a good instinct. And we're the most religious people on Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "One final point: President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal pro-abortion bill of any State in the Union.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer. But if I can get you back for a moment on my point, which was the question of when human life begins--a two-part followup. First of all, at what point do you believe that human life begins in the growth of a fetus? And second of all, you said that government shouldn't be involved in the decisions. Yet there are those who would say that government is involved, and the consequence of the involvement was 1.5 million abortions in 1980. And how do you feel about that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. The basic decision of the Supreme Court is that each person has to make this judgment in her own life, and that's the way it's been done. And it's a personal and private, moral judgment. I don't know the answer to when life begins. And it's not that simple, either. You've got another life involved. And if it's rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that? If it's incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that? Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment? It won't work. [Applause]\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. I'm sorry to do this, but I really must talk to the audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "You're all invited guests. I know I'm wasting time in talking to you, but it really is very unfair of you to applaud--sometimes louder, less loud--and I ask you, as people who were invited here, and polite people, to refrain.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have our time now for rebuttal. Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Yes. Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isn't that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I'm not capable, and I don't think you are, any of us, to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life. I am simply saying that I believe that that's where the effort should be directed--to make that determination.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition. That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that we're talking about a life. But in this great society of ours, wouldn't it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption? There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can't have them any other way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Mr. Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. I agree with that, and that's why I was a principal sponsor of a liberal adoption law, so that more of these children could come to term, so that the young mothers were educated, so we found an option, an alternative. I'm all for that. But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued. And I don't agree with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I've got about 20 seconds, let me just say one thing. The question of agriculture came up a minute ago. Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it. And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent. It's been a big failure. I opposed the grain embargo in my administration. I'm opposed to these policies as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. I'm sitting here like the great schoolteacher, letting you both get away with things--because one did it, the other one did it. May I ask in the future that the rebuttal stick to what the rebuttal is. And also, foreign policy will be the next debate. Stop dragging it in by its ear into this one. [Laughter]\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, having admonished you, I would like to say to the panel, you are allowed one question and one followup. Would you try, as best you could, not to ask two and three--I know it's something we all want to do--two and three questions as part one and two and three as part two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having said that, Fred, it's yours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Federal Taxation\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Barnes. Thank you. Mr. Mondale, let me ask you about middle-class Americans and the taxes they pay. Now, I'm talking not about the rich or the poor--I know your views on their taxes--but about families earning 25,000 to 45,000 a year. Do you think that those families are overtaxed or undertaxed by the Federal Government?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didn't get any relief the first time around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up. That's why my proposal protects everybody from $25,000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70,000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a fiat tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "What does this mean in real life? Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people. He's one of the wealthiest Americans, and he's our Vice President. In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes. In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes. That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe we need some fairness. And that's why I've proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who've already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Barnes. It sounds as if you are saying you think this group of taxpayers making 25,000 to 45,000 a year is already overtaxed, yet your tax proposal would increase their taxes. I think your aides have said those earning about 25,000 to 35,000, their tax rate would go up--their tax bill would go up a hundred dollars, and from 35,000 to 45,000, more than that, several hundred dollars. Wouldn't that stifle their incentive to work and invest and so on, and also hurt the recovery?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. The first thing is, everybody 25,000 and under would have no tax increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Reagan, after the election, is going to have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes. And his Secretary of the Treasury said he's studying a sales tax or a value-added tax. They're the same thing. They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up until about $70,000, as you go up the ladder, my proposals will be far more beneficial. As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, I'd like to see the total repeal of indexing. I don't think we can do that for a few years. But at some point, we want to do that as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Barnes. Mr. President, let me try this on you. Do you think middle-income Americans are overtaxed or undertaxed?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. You know, I wasn't going to say this at all, but I can't help it. There you go again. [Laughter] I don't have a plan to tax--or increase taxes. I'm not going to increase taxes. I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; it's that government is overfed. And I think that most of our people--this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up. And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from 50,000 down. From 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the Social Security tax of '77--this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest. It had two features. It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time--there are two more yet to come between now and 1989. At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money--virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there--that was subject to that tax. Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security. And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20--they're paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I don't think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn't work out that way. The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I've said, and that has not been changed. But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage, yes, you could say, well, that person got 10 times as much as this other person. Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also. But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Barnes. I thought I caught, Mr. President, a glimmer of a stronger statement there in your answer than you've made before. I think the operative position you had before was that you would only raise taxes in a second term as a last resort, and I thought you said flatly that \"I'm not going to raise taxes.\" Is that what you meant to say, that you will not--that you will flatly not raise taxes in your second term as President'?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Yes, I had used--\"last resort\" would always be with me. If you got the Government down to the lowest level, that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people, and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth, and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines, then I had said once that, yes, you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I'm not going to go for a tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there--had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust. All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Mr. Mondale, here we go again. It's time for rebuttal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. Well, first of all, I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the house deal. I'm just talking about the 12.8 percent that he paid, and that's what's happening all over this country with wealthy Americans. They've got so many loopholes they don't have to pay much in taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Mr. President, you said, \"There you go again,\" right?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. You remember the last time you said that?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Mm-hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. You said it when President Carter said that you were going to cut Medicare, and you said, \"Oh, no, there you go again, Mr. President.\" And what did you do right after the election? You went out and tried to cut $20 billion out of Medicare. And so, when you say, \"There you go again\"--people remember this, you know. [Laughter] And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States, and what are you going to do? You've got a $260 billion deficit. You can't wish it away. You won't slow defense spending; you refuse to do that--\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Mr. Mondale, I'm afraid your time is up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. Sorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Mr. President?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Yes. With regard to Medicare, no, but it's time for us to say that Medicare is in pretty much the same condition that Social Security was, and something is going to have to be done in the next several years to make it fiscally sound. And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem. And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. All right. Fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. I gave you back some of that time. [Laughter]\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. We can't keep going back for other rebuttals; there'll be time later.\n",
      "\n",
      "We now go to our final round. The way things stand now, we have time for only two sets of questions, and by lot, it will be Jim and Diane. And we'll start with Jim Wieghart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Social Welfare Programs\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wieghart. Mr. President, the economic recovery is real, but uneven. The Census Bureau, just a month ago, reported that there are more people living under poverty now, a million more people living under it, than when you took office.\n",
      "\n",
      "There have been a number of studies, including studies by the Urban Institute and other nonpolitical organizations, that say that the impact of the tax and budget cuts and your economic policies have impacted severely on certain classes of Americans-working mothers, head of households, minority groups, elderly poor. In fact, they're saying the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer under your policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "What relief can you offer to the working poor, to the minorities, and to the women head of households who have borne the brunt of these economic programs? What can you offer them in the future, in your next term?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Well, some of those facts and figures just don't stand up. Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here. It has begun to decline, but it is still going up.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, women heads of household--single women heads of household have--for the first time there's been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them. We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings. It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980. We're spending a third more on all of the-well, all of the programs of human service. We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before--2,300,000 more are receiving them--even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them. We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits. We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind. Half--one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid. But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans. We didn't think that was right. And so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have. 7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings--7.7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wieghart. Mr. President, in a visit to Texas--in Brownsville, I believe it was, in the Rio Grande Valley--you did observe that the economic recovery was uneven.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wieghart. In that particular area of Texas, unemployment was over 14 percent, whereas statewide, it was the lowest in the country, I believe--5.6 percent. And you made the comment, however, that man does not live by bread alone. What did you mean by that comment? And if I interpret it correctly, it would be a comment more addressed to the affluent who obviously can look beyond just the bread they need to sustain them, with their wherewithal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything. I remember distinctly, I was segueing into another subject. I was talking about the things that have been accomplished, and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism, the new spirit that we're finding all over America. And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people. So, that was the only place that that was used.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did avoid, I'm afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes. There is no way that the recovery is even across the country, just as in the depths of the recession, there were some parts of the country that were worse off, but some that didn't even feel the pain of the recession.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're not going to rest and not going to be happy until every person in this country who wants a job can have one, until the recovery is complete across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wieghart. Mr. Mondale, as you can gather from the question to the President, the celebrated War on Poverty obviously didn't end the problem of poverty, although it may have dented it. The poor and the homeless and the disadvantaged are still with us. What should the Federal Government's role be to turn back the growth in the number of people living below the poverty level, which is now 35 million in the United States, and to help deal with the structural unemployment problems that the President was referring to in an uneven recovery?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. Number one, we've got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Number two, we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities--through the Urban Development Action Grant Program. I don't mind those enterprise zones; let's try them, but not as a substitute for the others. Certainly education and training is crucial. If these young Americans don't have the skills that make them attractive to employees, they're not going to get jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which they're found. The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no question that the poor are worse off. I think the President genuinely believes that they're better off. But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago. How you can cut school lunches, how you can cut student assistance, how you can cut housing, how you can cut disability benefits, how you can do all of these things and then the people receiving them for example, the disabled, who have no alternative--how they're going to do better, I don't know. Now, we need a tight budget, but there's no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they're hurting.\n",
      "\n",
      "One final point if I might. There's another part of the lopsided economy that we're in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports. We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year. That's another reason to get the deficit down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wieghart. Mr. Mondale, is it possible that the vast majority of Americans who appear to be prosperous have lost interest in the kinds of programs you're discussing to help those less privileged than they are?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent. I think they stand for civil rights. I know they're all for education in science and training, which I strongly support. They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest. I think the business community wants to get involved. I think they're asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved. I think that's part of it. I think also that the American people want a balanced program that gives us long-term growth so that they're not having to take money that's desperate to themselves and their families and give it to someone else. I'm opposed to that, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. And now it is time for our rebuttal for this period. Mr. President?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Yes. The connection that's been made again between the deficit and the interest rates--there is no connection between them. There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited--that the interest rates came down from 21 1/2, down toward the 12 or 13 figure. And while they were coming down, the deficits had started their great increase. They were going up. Now, if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interest rates are based on inflation. And right now I have to tell you I don't think there is any excuse for the interest rates being as high as they are because we have brought inflation down so low. I think it can only be that they're anticipating or hope--expecting, not hoping, that maybe we don't have a control of inflation and it's going to go back up again. Well, it isn't going to go back up. We're going to see that it doesn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I haven't got time to answer with regard to the disabled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Thank you, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits don't have anything to do with interest rates. I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why--energy prices and so on. There's no way of glossing around that. But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981, what's called the real interest rates--the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled--and that's still the case today. And the result is interest costs that have never been seen before in terms of real charges, and it's attributable to the deficit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody--every economist, every businessman-believes that. Your own Council of Economic Advisers--Mr. Feldstein in his report told you that. Every chairman of the Finance and Ways and Means Committee, Republican leaders in the Senate and the House are telling you that. That deficit is ruining the long-term hopes for this economy. It's causing high interest rates. It's ruining us in trade. It's given us the highest small business failure in 50 years. The economy is starting downhill with housing failure.-\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Thank you, Mr. Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "You're both very obedient. I have to give you credit for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "We now start our final round of questions. We do want to have time for your rebuttal.\n",
      "\n",
      "We start with Diane--Diane Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presidential Campaign\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer. Since we are reaching the end of the question period, and since in every Presidential campaign, the candidates tend to complain that the opposition candidate is not held accountable for what he or she says, let me give you the chance to do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale, beginning with you. What do you think the most outrageous thing is your opponent said in this debate tonight? [Laughter]\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. Do you want to give me some suggestions? [Laughter] I'm going to use my time a little differently. I'm going to give the President some credit. I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit, morale, good feeling in this country, and he's entitled to credit for that. What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with America's problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didn't like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit. But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like President Reagan. And this is not personal--there are deep differences about our future, and that's the basis of my campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer. Follow up in a similar vein, then. What remaining question would you most like to see your opponent forced to answer?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. Without any doubt, I have stood up and told the American people that that $263 billion deficit must come down. And I've done what no candidate for President has ever done, I told you before the election what I'd do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Reagan, as you saw tonight--President Reagan takes the position it will disappear by magic. It was once called voodoo economics. I wish the President would say: Yes, the CBO is right. Yes, we have a $263 billion deficit. This is how I'm going to get it done. Don't talk about growth, because even though we need growth, that's not helping. It's going to go in the other direction, as they've estimated.\n",
      "\n",
      "And give us a plan. What will you cut? Whose taxes will you raise? Will you finally touch that defense budget? Are you going to go after Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and the handicapped again as you did last time? If you'd just tell us what you're going to do, then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan. And that's the way it should be. The American people would be in charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer. Mr. President, the most outrageous thing your opponent has said in the debate tonight?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Well, now, I have to start with a smile, since his kind words to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog, both in this campaign and the one in '82. And that is the continued discussion and claim that somehow I am the villain who is going to pull the Social Security checks out from those people who are dependent on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "And why I think it is outrageous--first of all, it isn't true. But why it is outrageous is because, for political advantage, every time they do that, they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security, have no place else to turn. And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, \"Is this true? Is someone going to take our check away from us and leave us destitute?\" And I don't think that that should be a part of political dialog.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, to--I still--I just have a minute here?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. You have more time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Oh, I--\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. You can keep going.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Okay. All right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Social Security, let's lay it to rest once and for all. I told you never would I do such a thing. But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit. Social Security is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on employer and employee. If you reduce the out-go of Social Security, that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit. It would go into the Social Security Trust Fund. So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, again, to get to whether I am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldn't work. And then, after it worked, I was told that lowering taxes would increase inflation. And none of these things happened. It is working, and we're going to continue on that same line.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to what we might do, and find in further savings cuts, no, we're not going to starve the hungry. But we have 2,478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2,000 business people in this country, through the Grace commission, that we're studying right now--and we've already implemented 17 percent of them-that are recommendations as to how to make government more efficient, more economic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer. And to keep it even, what remaining question would you most like to see your opponent forced to answer?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now, but that in 1976, when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone was panicking about that, he said, no, that he thought it ought to be bigger, because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment. In 1979 he made similar statements, the same effect, that the deficits-there was nothing wrong with having deficits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here. That's got to be paid by our children and grandchildren, too, if we don't do it. And I'm hoping we can start some payments on it before we get through here. That's why I want another 4 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Well, we have time now, if you'd like to answer the President's question, or whatever rebuttal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. Well, we've just finished almost the whole debate. And the American people don't have the slightest clue about what President Reagan will do about these deficits. [Laughter] And yet, that's the most important single issue of our time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did support the '76 measure that he told about, because we were in a deep recession and we needed some stimulation. But I will say as a Democrat, I was a real piker, Mr. President. In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year. This administration seems to run that every morning. And the result is exactly what we see. This economy is starting to run downhill. Housing is off. Last report on new purchases, it's the lowest since 1982. Growth is a little over 3 percent now. Many people are predicting a recession. And the flow of imports into this country is swamping the American people.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've got to deal with this problem, and those of us who want to be your President should tell you now what we're going to do, so you can make a judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Thank you very much. We must stop now. I want to give you time for your closing statements. It's indeed time for that from each of you. We will begin with President Reagan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Reagan, you had your rebuttal, and I just cut you off because our time is going. You have a chance now for rebuttal before your closing statement. Is that correct?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. No, I might as well just go with-\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Do you want to go with your--\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. I don't think so. I'm all confused now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Technically, you did. I have little voices that come in my ear. [Laughter] You don't get those same voices. I'm not hearing it from here--I'm hearing it from here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. All right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. You have waived your rebuttal. You can go with your closing statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Closing Statements\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Well, we'll include it in that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Four years ago, in similar circumstances to this, I asked you, the American people, a question. I asked: \"Are you better off than you were 4 years before?\" The answer to that obviously was no, and as the result, I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, maybe I'm expected to ask that same question again. I'm not going to, because I think that all of you--or not everyone, those people that are in those pockets of poverty and haven't caught up, they couldn't answer the way I would want them to--but I think that most of the people in this country would say, yes, they are better off than they were 4 years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question, I think, should be enlarged. Is America better off than it was 4 years ago? And I believe the answer to that has to also be \"yes.\" I promised a new beginning. So far, it is only a beginning. If the job were finished, I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we now have an economy that, for the first time--well, let's put it this way: In the first half of 1980, gross national product was down a minus 3.7 percent. The first half of '84 it's up 8 1/2 percent. Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent. Today it is up a plus 4 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost $3,000 in these 4 years. In 1980--or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8,000 was $500 above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty. By 1980 that same person was $500 below the poverty line.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have restored much of our economy. With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since 1949. So, there seems to be no shortage of investment capital. We have, as I said, cut the taxes, but we have reduced inflation, and for 2 years now it has stayed down there, not at double digit, but in the range of 4 or below. We believe that we had also promised that we would make our country more secure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, we have an increase in the defense budget. But back then we had planes that couldn't fly for lack of spare parts or pilots. We had navy vessels that couldn't leave harbor because of lack of crew or, again, lack of spare parts. Today we're well on our way to a 600-ship navy. We have 543 at present.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have--our military, the morale is high. I think the people should understand that two-thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary, or pay and pension. And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons. But I am determined that if ever our men are called on, they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons. There has been reference to expensive spare parts, hammers costing $500. Well, we are the ones who found those.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we've given the American people back their spirit. I think there's an optimism in the land and a patriotism, and I think that we're in a position once again to heed the words of Thomas Paine, who said: \"We have it in our power to begin the world over again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Thank you, Mr. Reagan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale, the closing words are now yours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale. I want to thank the League of Women Voters and the city of Louisville for hosting this evening's debate. I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate. He didn't have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President's favorite question is: Are you better off?. Well, if you're wealthy, you're better off. If you're middle income, you're about where you were. And if you're modest income, you're worse off. That's what the economists tell us.\n",
      "\n",
      "But is that really the question that should be asked? Isn't the real question is will we be better off?. Will our children be better off?. Are we building the future that this nation needs? I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, you'll see that we need new leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are we better of with this arms race? Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens? Are we better off when we de-emphasize our values in human rights? Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt? Would fathers and mothers feel proud of themselves if they loaded their children with debts like this nation is now--over a trillion dollars on the shoulders of our children? Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness?\n",
      "\n",
      "I would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self-interest. I don't think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves. And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited. When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability-confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I don't think that's what America is all about.\n",
      "\n",
      "America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him. I believe there's fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment. And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful. These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price. That's not fair for our future.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and we're being pressed harder all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe in opening doors. We won the Olympics, in part, because we've had civil rights laws and the laws that prohibit discrimination against women. I have been for those efforts all my life. The President's record is quite different.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question is our future. President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, \"We are great, but we can be greater.\" We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters. Thank you, Mr. Mondale. [Applause] Please, we have not finished quite yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. Mondale, and thank you, Mr. President. And our thanks to our panel members, as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so we bring to a close this first of the League of Women Voters Presidential debates of 1984. You two can go at each again in the final League debate on October 21st, in Kansas City, Missouri. And this Thursday night, October 11th, at 9 p.m. eastern daylight time, the Vice President, George Bush, will debate Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro in Philadelphia.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I hope that you will all watch once again. No matter what the format is, these debates are very important. We all have an extremely vital decision to make.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more, gentlemen, our thanks. Once more, to you, our thanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, this is Barbara Walters wishing you a good evening.\n",
      "Jim Lehrer. Good evening from the Shiley Theatre at the University of San Diego, San Diego, California. I'm Jim Lehrer of the \"NewsHour\" on PBS. Welcome to this second 1996 Presidential debate between Senator Bob Dole, the Republican nominee, and President Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee. It is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will follow a townhall-type format tonight. The questions over the next 90 minutes will come from 113 citizens of the greater San Diego area. They were chosen in the past week by the Gallup organization to represent a rough cross-section of voters as to political views, age, gender, and other factors. Each said he or she is undecided about this Presidential race.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were told to come tonight with questions. Nobody from the Debate Commission or the two campaigns has any idea what those questions are; neither do I. We will all be hearing them for the first time at the same time. I met with this group 3 hours ago, and we spoke only about how it was going to work tonight. They are sitting in five sections. I will call on individuals at random, moving from one section to another with each new question, alternating the questions between the two candidates. My job is to keep things fair and the subjects as clear and as varied as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rules, drawn by the campaigns, are basically the same as they were for the Hartford and St. Petersburg debates: 90-second answers, 60-second rebuttals, 30-second responses for each question. The candidates are not allowed to question each other directly. There will be 2-minute opening and closing statements. The order for this evening was set by coin toss.\n",
      "\n",
      "We begin now with Senator Dole and his opening statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opening Statements\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Bob Dole. Thank you very much, Jim.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me first give you a sports update: the Braves, one; Cardinals, nothing—early on.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to thank you and I want to thank everybody here tonight, and I want a special thanks to my wife, Elizabeth, and my daughter, Robin, for their love and support, and thank the people who are listening and watching all over America.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 20 days, you will help decide who will lead this country into the next century. It's an awesome responsibility. And you must ask yourself, do you know enough about the candidates? You should know as much as possible about each of us. Sometimes the views have been distorted—and millions and millions of dollars in negative advertising spent distorting my views— but I hope tonight you'll get a better feel of who Bob Dole is and what he's all about.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I think first you should—I should understand that the question on your mind is, do I understand your problem? But I understand it if—it occurred to me and I might just say that I'm from a large family. I've got lots of relatives, and they're good, average, middle class, hard-working Americans. They live all across the country. They're not all Republicans—maybe all but one. [Laughter]\n",
      "\n",
      "But in any event, I understand the problems, whether it's two parents working because one has to pay the taxes and one has to provide for the family; whether it's a single parent who just barely pays the pressing bills; or whether you're worried about an education for your children—are they going to the best schools; or whether you're worried about safe playgrounds, drug-free schools, crime-free schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is what this election is all about. And hopefully tonight when we conclude this debate, you will have a better understanding and the viewing and listening audience will have a better understanding. Thank you. [Applause]\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. Mr. President, 2 minutes, opening statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. I was going to applaud, too. [Laughter]\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, thank you, Jim, and thanks to the people of San Diego for giving us this opportunity to have another discussion about the decision we all face in front of people who will make the decision. Again I will say, I'll do my best to make this a discussion of ideas and issues, not insults. What really matters is what happens to your future and what happens to our country as we stand on the brink of a new century, a time of extraordinary possibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a simple philosophy that I've tried to follow for the last 4 years: Do what creates opportunity for all, what reinforces responsibility from all of us, and what will help us build a community where everybody's got a role to play and a place at the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to 4 years ago, we're clearly better off. We've got 10 1/2 million more jobs; the deficit's been reduced by 60 percent; incomes are rising for the first time in a decade; the crime rates, the welfare rolls are falling; we're putting 100,000 more police on the street; 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers have been denied handguns.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that progress is only the beginning. What we really should focus on tonight is what we still have to do to help the American people make the most of this future that's out there. I think what really matters is what we can do to help build strong families. Strong families need a strong economy. To me, that means we have to go on and balance this budget while we protect Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should give a tax cut targeted to childrearing and education, to buying a first home and paying for health care. We ought to help protect our kids from drugs and guns and gangs and tobacco. We ought to help move a million people from welfare to work. And we ought to create the finest education system in the world, where every 18-year-old can go on to college and all of our younger children have great educational opportunities. If we do those things, we can build that bridge to the 21st century. That's what I hope to get to talk about tonight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. All right, let's go now to the first question from this section, and it's for Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, ma'am? Yes?\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. Hello, Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Hi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leadership To Promote Unity\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. My name is Shannon MacAfee. I'm a beginning educator in this country, and I really think it's important what children have to say. They're still very idealistic, and everything they say comes from the heart. I have a quote for you from \"If I Were President,\" compiled by Peggy Gavin. A sixth grader says, \"If I were President, I would think about Abraham Lincoln and George Washington and what they did to make our country great. We should unite the white and black people and people of all cultures. Democrats and Republicans should unite also. We should all come together and think of the best ways to solve the economic problems of our country. I believe that when we are able to come together and stop fighting amongst ourselves, we will get along a lot better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "These are the ideals and morals that we are trying to teach our children in these days, yet we don't seem to be practicing them in our Government, in anything. If you are President, how will you begin to practice what we are preaching to our children, the future of our Nation?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, I would say, first of all, I think it's a very good question, and I appreciate the quote from the young man.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's no doubt about it that many American people have lost their faith in government. They see scandals almost on a daily basis. They see ethical problems in the White House today. They see 900 FBI files of private persons being gathered up by somebody in the White House; nobody knows who hired this man. So there's a great deal of cynicism out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I've always tried, in whatever I've done, to bring people together. I said in my acceptance speech in San Diego about 2 months ago that the exits are clearly marked. If you think the Republican Party is someplace for you to come if you're narrow-minded or bigoted or don't like certain people in America, the exits are clearly marked for you to walk out of, as I stand here without compromise because this is the party of Lincoln.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we have a real obligation, obviously, public officials. I'm no longer a public official; I left public life on June 11th of this year. But it is very important. Young people are looking to us. They're looking to us for leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "They're watching what we do, what we say, what we promise, and what we finally deliver. And I would think—it seems to me that there are opportunities here. When I'm President of the United States, I will keep my word. My word is my bond.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. Mr. President?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. One of the reasons that I ran for President, Sandy, is because not just children, a lot of grownups felt that way. If you remember, 4 years ago we had not only rising unemployment but a lot of rising cynicism. I'd never worked in Washington as an elected official. It seemed to me that most of the arguments were partisan: Republican, Democrat; left, right; liberal, conservative. That's why I said tonight I'm for opportunity, responsibility, and community. And we've gotten some real progress in the last 4 years. I've also done everything I could at every moment of division in this country—after Oklahoma City, when these churches were burned—to bring people together and remind people that we are stronger because of our diversity. We have to respect one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "You mentioned Washington and Lincoln; they were Presidents at historic times. This is an historic time. It's important that we go beyond those old partisan arguments and focus on people and their future. When we do that, instead of shutting the Government down over a partisan fight on the budget, we're a better country, and that's why we're making progress now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. Senator?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, bringing people together again is obviously a responsibility we all have. I know you do it. Everybody here does it. You do a lot of things nobody knows about. I have a little foundation for the disabled called the Dole Foundation. We've raised about $10 million. We don't talk about it. We try to help people with disabilities. We bring them back into the mainstream of public life.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it seems to me that there's also a public trust. When you're the President of the United States, you have a public trust, and you have to keep that public trust, as George Washington did and as Abraham Lincoln did. And I think now that trust is being violated. And it seems to me we ought to face up to it, and the President ought to say tonight that he's not going to pardon anybody that he was involved in business with who might implicate him later on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. All right, the next question from this section right here. Right there in the middle, sir. Yes, sir?\n",
      "\n",
      "Health Care\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. Dr. Robert Berkeley; I'm a cardiologist from Fallbrook, California. Mr. President, I'd like to know if you'd please explain your plans for—in a substantive fashion, for addressing the problems with the health care system in our country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. I will. First of all, let me say what we have done: In the last 4 years, we've worked hard to promote more competition to bring down the rate of inflation in health care costs without eroding health care quality. The Government pays for Medicare and Medicaid, as you know, and that's very important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, we've added a million more children to the ranks of the insured through the Medicaid program. We have protected 25 million people through the passage of the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that says you can't lose your health insurance if you change jobs or if someone in your family's been sick. We just recently ended those drive-by deliveries, saying people couldn't be kicked out of the hospital by insurance companies when they'd just had babies. So this is—that's a good start.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the next 4 years, I want to focus on the following things: Number one, add another million children to the insured ranks through the Medicaid program; number two, keep working with the States, as we are now, to add 2.2 million more people to the insurance system; number three, cover people who are between jobs for up to 6 months—that could protect 3 million families, 700,000 kids; and number four, make sure we protect the integrity of the Medicare program and the Medicaid program and not do anything in cutting costs which would cause hundreds of hospitals to close, as could have been the case if the $270 billion Medicare cut that I vetoed had been enacted into law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. First, let me say there you go again, Mr. President, talking about a Medicare cut. Now, I've heard you say this time after time, and I've heard you say on one TV appearance, \"The media made me do it.\" You were trying to defend your cut, which was not a cut either—a reduction in the growth of spending. And we always had at least 7 percent. You've said publicly that it's now 3 times the rate of inflation, we ought to cut the growth to twice the rate of inflation. That's about where we are now. So let's stop talking about cutting Medicare. In my economic plan we increase it 39 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't forget what he tried to do with health care: 17 new taxes, spend $1.5 trillion, 50 new bureaucracies. Can you believe that? You couldn't even have been a cardiologist because they had quotas. You had—you couldn't—you're a cardiologist; it wouldn't affect you. But if somebody wanted to be a cardiologist 10 years from now, you'd have to be certain that you complied with some of the rules in this extreme medical plan the Government was going to take over for all Americans. There are things we can do like the Kassebaum bill, that retains many provisions I authored, to cover preexisting—existing—portability. And there are other things we can do. We still need to cover about 20 million people and a lot of children.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. I don't have time in 30 seconds to respond to fix all that. But let me just say, the American Hospital Association said that the budget I vetoed could have closed 700 hospitals, not me. And on a per-person basis, it did cut way below the rate of inflation in medical costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the important thing is, what are we going to do now? We need to help people who are between jobs. We need to cover more kids. We need to provide more preventive care. My balanced budget covers mammograms for ladies on—women on Medicare and also gives respite care to the million-plus families who have someone with Alzheimer's. These things are paid for in the balanced budget plan. It will move us forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. The next question is for Senator Dole from here. Yes, sir?\n",
      "\n",
      "Armed Forces\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. Senator Dole, my name is Jason Milligan, active-duty military and a small-business owner. And my question is, what is your position on closing the gap between military and civilian pay scales?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Jason, I appreciate that very much, being a former military man myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know, we have 17,000 men and women today wearing our uniform that receive food stamps. It shouldn't happen in America. We have men and women wearing our uniform in substandard housing. It shouldn't happen in America. And it's time we take a look at the pay scales. You did get a 3 percent increase this year, but that's not enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we're going to ask young men and young women to protect us and defend us around the world, and we've had more deployments under this administration than any time in history— 50 times we deployed troops around the world. Every time you do that, you take a risk—somebody you know, maybe your son, maybe your grandson, maybe somebody else. But I think anybody who wears a uniform is a great American. Remember Vietnam, remember when people almost used to walk across the street rather than have contact with somebody who was in Vietnam—that's all behind us now, and it should be behind us—and the forgotten war, the Korean war. But I guess, I can just answer you very plainly, Jason: Thank you for doing what you're doing. America owes you a debt of gratitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. May I ask you a question? What kind of—which service are you in?\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. I'm in the United States Navy, sir.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. And what kind of small business do you have?\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. I have an Amway business.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Good for you. Well, let me say—Senator Dole mentioned this. I just signed a bill that we got through Congress to increase the amount of pay increase we could give for military personnel and to make sure the pay increase this year was above the rate of inflation. I also had presented to the Congress, and they adopted, a large package of quality-of-life improvements which are very important. I've spent a lot of time talking to military families, as well as military members, all over the world and in bases all across the United States. And I became convinced, after talking to the families and the personnel in uniform, that we needed to not only have the pay raise but we needed to invest more in child care, housing, and other things to support families, especially when there are longer deployments because of the downsizing of the military.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we're going to do better, and we'll do better still. But this is a commitment I think that all Americans share, without regard to party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. Senator Dole?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, Jason, I don't disagree with anything the President said except he waited 4 years to do these things. And my view is it ought to be—it'll be done on day one.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll start working on it on day one in the Dole-Kemp administration. This is important. Now, we only have 10 divisions now; we used to have 18. We had 25 fighter wings; we're down to 13. We had 536 ships; we're down to 336 ships. I mean, we've cut defense spending too much in the first place. The President told you in '92 he would cut it $67 billion; he cut $112 billion. So we're right on the edge right now. But the last thing we ought to do is make those who wear the uniform sacrifice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. Next question here for President Clinton. Yes, ma'am, here on the front row.\n",
      "\n",
      "Middle East Peace Process\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. President Clinton, my name is Cecily Kelly. Yesterday Yasser Arafat said in Palestine that he thinks the key to success in the Middle East is the commitment of Americans. Would you, as President, send American troops to Israel or the West Bank as peacekeepers?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Let me just take 2 seconds of my time, because I'm the Commander in Chief, to respond to one thing that was said. I propose to spend $1.6 trillion on defense between now and the year 2002. And there's less than one percent difference between my budget and the Republican budget on defense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, on the Middle East, as you know, I've worked very hard for peace in the Middle East. The agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis was signed at the White House. And the agreement, the peace treaty with Jordan, I went to Jordan to sign that, to be there. But— and I think the United States could do whatever we reasonably can.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can say this: I do not believe Yasser Arafat wants us to send troops to the West Bank. We have never been asked to send troops to the West Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw the agreement that Prime Minister Rabin and Yasser Arafat signed on the West Bank. It had 26 separate maps they had to sign, literally thousands of delineations of who would do what on the West Bank. And I believe if the parties will get together and in a good faith manner make that agreement, that they'll be able to do it. We cannot impose a peace on the Middle East.\n",
      "\n",
      "My position has always been that the job of the United States was to minimize the risks of peace. You know, if they ask me to be part of some monitoring force—as we are in the Sinai and have been since 1978 to monitor the peace between Egypt and Israel—frankly, I would have to think about it; I would have to see what they wanted to do. But I don't believe that will be the request. I think what Mr. Arafat wants us to do is to make sure that everybody honors the agreements they've already made. That's why I brought the leaders to Washington a few days ago. I think they will, and I think we'll get there. Don't be too discouraged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, let me, Jason, come back to you a minute because there is a big difference in the defense budget. We had $7 billion this year, and $10 billion more than the President. He puts his money in the out years— even if he were reelected, you know, he'd be gone before anything happened. And nothing's going to happen, because we don't have modernization now. If we don't build more B-2 bombers in California—and we lost about 500,000 jobs out in California because of this devastation, these big, big cuts. We had to make cuts; we didn't have to make the cuts the President promised he'd make and then he doubled. And so I think we need to go back and take a look. We're increasing defense reasonably, not too much but we are increasing defense some, because we want to be prepared in case somebody here gets called up, Jason.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would say I didn't hear what Yasser Arafat had to say, but I don't want to—you know, I think foreign policy is something we want to be very careful about. And I'm not here to argue about the President on some ongoing foreign policy matter. What I want the President to do, and I think he may have done it in his last statement, is call for an unconditional end to the violence and have the parties keep on talking as they should talk and have a resolution. The last thing we want to do is commit more forces anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's sort of keep this out of politics, because it's pretty dicey right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. When the change of government occurred in Israel, the people of Israel were saying, \"We don't want to abandon the peace process. We want more security.\" Then, a lot of mutual distrust developed. A lot of things happened which maybe shouldn't have happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I asked Yasser Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to Washington and got them together and they talked alone for 3 hours, I was convinced that they had to have a chance to make that peace. Again, I'd say if they ask us to play some reasonable role, I don't know how I would respond. It would depend entirely on what they ask us to do. But the real secret there is for them to abide by the agreements they've made and find a way to trust each other. And they're going to have to spend some time and trust each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prime Minister Rabin gave his life believing that that trust could be materialized, and I still think it can be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. All right, next question from this section, and it is for Senator Dole. Back in the back. Yes, sir, right there. Yes, sir.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tobacco\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. Senator Dole, Oscar Delgado.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Oscar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. Ex-smoker for 30 years. About 30 years ago I was a pack-plus-a-day man, okay? You mentioned in a statement, you said some time ago that you didn't think nicotine was addictive. Would you care to—you still hold to that statement, or do you wish to recant or explain yourself?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Oh, that—that's very easy. My record going back to 1965 in the Congress, the first vote we had was whether or not you should put a little notice on cigarettes that they may be dangerous—I voted—I voted for everything since that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, in 1992 we had a bill come before us that all the States had to comply or they're going to lose certain money. We sent it to the Clinton administration for implementation. They waited 3 1/2 years. And during that period about 3,000 young kids every day started smoking. If you add it up, that's about 3 million—not until again 1996.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't want anybody to smoke. My brother probably died partly because of cigarettes. I was asked a technical question: Are they addictive? Maybe they—they probably are addictive. I don't know; I'm not a doctor. You shouldn't smoke. You ought to be glad you quit, Oscar— 30 years?\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. And it seems to me that what we need to do is to talk about not only tobacco but drugs, because drug use in 12- and 17year-olds has doubled in this administration, the last 44 months. Marijuana use is up 141 percent; cocaine use, up 160 percent. They're your kids. It's all happened in this administration because they cut funding and they cut interdiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I'm President of the United States, we're going to use the National Guard and whatever resources we need to stop some of the drugs coming into America. If you stop the drugs, nobody is going to use the drugs. So don't smoke, don't drink, don't use drugs. Just don't do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Oscar, the question of what the Federal Government should do to limit the access of tobacco to young people is one of the biggest differences between Senator Dole and me.\n",
      "\n",
      "We did propose a regulation 6 months after I became President under the law he mentioned. It simply says all these States—it made it illegal for kids to smoke—now they have to try harder if they want to keep getting Federal funds. Then we took comments, as we always do, and there were tens of thousands of comments about how we ought to do it. That's what drug it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, we started, also in '93, to look into whether cigarettes were addictive enough for the Federal Food and Drug Administration to ban the ability of cigarette companies to advertise, market, and distribute tobacco products to our kids. No President had ever taken on the tobacco lobby before. I did. Senator Dole opposed me. He went down and made a speech to people who were on his side, saying that I did the wrong thing. I think I did the right thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "On drugs, I have repeatedly said drugs are wrong and illegal and can kill you. We have strengthened enforcement, and everybody in San Diego knows we've strengthened control of the border. We've done a lot more; I hope we get a chance to talk about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, they also know, if they live in San Diego, Mr. President, if you're caught with 125 pounds of marijuana or less, you go back to Mexico; you're not prosecuted. You have a U.S. Attorney here that sends them back home. So I think that's pretty important. That's a lot of marijuana. That's a big supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "But don't—you know, don't get into this smokescreen here, Oscar. The President, in the election year, decided, \"Well, I ought to do something. I haven't done anything on drugs. I've been AWOL for 44 months. So let's take on smoking.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But see, they haven't even done it. They haven't said what's going to happen, whether they're going to have it declared addictive; it's going to apply just to—once it's a drug, does it apply only to teenagers or to everybody in America?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody should smoke, young or old. But particularly, young people should not smoke. And my record is there. It's been there. I've voted 8, 10 times since 1965.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. The next question is for President Clinton, and it comes from right here. Yes, sir?\n",
      "\n",
      "Social Security and Medicare\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. President Clinton, my name is Jack Fleck. I'm a retired Air Force pilot. Sir, it's officially forecast that our annual Medicare and Social Security deficits are measured in the trillions of dollars next century. Depending upon who you listen to, Social Security will be bankrupt in either 2025 or 2030. I feel this is grossly unfair, especially to our younger generations, who are losing faith in the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "My question is this: Assuming you agree that our entitlement programs are on an unsustainable course, what specific reforms do you propose?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. First of all, they're two different things. Social Security and Medicare are entirely different in terms of the financial stabilities. Let's talk about them separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Social Security is stable until, as you pointed out, at least the third decade of the next century. But we'd like to have a Social Security fund that has about 70 years of life instead of about 30 years of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we have to do is simply to make some adjustments that take account of the fact that the baby boomers, people like me, are bigger in number than the people that went just before us and the people that come just after us. And I think what we'll plainly do is what we did in 1983, when Senator Dole served—and this is something I think he did a good job on— when he served on the Social Security Commission and they made some modest changes in Social Security to make sure that it would be alive and well into the 21st century. And we will do that. It's obvious that there are certain things that have to be done, and there are 50 to 60 different options. And a bipartisan commission, to take it out of politics, will make recommendations and build support for the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medicare is different. Medicare needs help now. I have proposed a budget which would put 10 years on the life of the Medicare Trust Fund; that's more than it's had a lot of the time for the last 20 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would save a lot of money through more managed care but giving more options, more preventive care, and lowering the inflation rate in the prices we're paying providers without having the kind of big premium increases and outof-pocket costs that the budget I vetoed would provide. Then that will give us 10 years to do with Medicare what we're going to do with Social Security: have a bipartisan group look at what we have to do to save it when the baby boomers retire. But now we ought to pass this budget now and put 10 years on it right away so no one has to worry about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, again, you know, if you're somebody thinking about the future, I think it's fair to say that it'll be—we'll work it out. I mean, this is a political year, and the President's playing politics with Medicare. But after this year's over we'll resolve it just as we did with Social Security in 1983. It was a nonpartisan commission. Ronald Reagan got together with Tip O'Neill and Howard Baker—two Republicans and one Democrat—and they formed a commission. I was on that commission. We resolved—we rescued Social Security. We suggested—I think it's been over a year ago now— we do the same with Medicare, and the White House called it a gimmick. Now last week, I guess it was, Donna Shalala said, \"Well, we'll cut Medicare a hundred billion, and we'll appoint a commission.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It will probably have to be done by a commission. Take it out of politics. I think if I were a senior citizen I'd be a little fed up with all these ads scaring seniors, scaring veterans, and scaring students about education. But when you don't have any ideas, when you don't have any agenda, and all you have is fear, that's all you can use. We have ideas in the Dole-Kemp campaign, and we'll rescue Medicare as we did Social Security.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Their idea was to have the poorest seniors in the country pay $270 more a year this year. Their idea was to budget— that the American Hospital Association said could close 700 hospitals. Their idea was to charge everybody more out-of-pocket costs in their budget that I vetoed—not in an election year, sir, I told them in early '95.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole said 30 years ago he was one of 12 people that voted against Medicare and he was proud of it. A year ago he said, \"I was right then; I knew it wouldn't work.\" American seniors have the highest life expectancy in the world. We need to reform it, not wreck it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. Next question from here, and it's for Senator Dole. Yes, ma'am, right here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. Me?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Welfare Reform\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. Senator Dole, my name is Suzanne Gonzalez, and I would like to know what you are— what would be your first step in reforming welfare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, we've taken the first step. We took it three steps. Twice we sent welfare reform to the President, and he vetoed it. On the third time we sent welfare reform to the President, he signed it but announced he would change it next year. And the Vice President said they were going to do something else through the line item veto, which I've never understood, but that's sort of inside baseball.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we need to do is make certain we try to return people to work. And I'm standing here as someone who a long time ago—as the county attorney in Russell, Kansas, one of our jobs every month was to go through all the welfare checks and sign them. And three of those checks were my grandparents'. So I know what it's like to have to look welfare head-on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously some people are going to need help. This is the United States of America. You're not going to go without food, and you're not going to go without medical care. This is America. But at the same time, if you want to get off Medicare, get back in the mainstream, we're going to provide jobs. We're going to say you have a 5-year limit that you can be on welfare. You've got 2 years to look for a job. We provided more money for day care in the bill that passed the Senate and was vetoed. Then it came back, and the President signed pretty much the same bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is an important issue. I don't think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants. I mean, it puts a heavy burden on a State like—except for emergencies. It puts a heavy burden on States like California. It costs California taxpayers $3 billion a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. President Clinton?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. I'll get out of your way here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. It's illegal right now and has been for years for illegal immigrants to get welfare benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me say that this is one of the most important issues in the world to me. I started working on welfare reform in 1980 because I was sick of seeing people trapped in a system that was increasingly physically isolating them and making their kids more vulnerable to get in trouble. So I'd been working on it when I was a Governor for a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I became President, I used the authority I had in this law to get out from under certain Federal rules to help States move people to work. We've reduced the welfare rolls by 2 million already. Now I've got a plan with this new welfare reform law to work with the private sector to give employers specific tax incentives to hire people off welfare and to do some other things which will create more jobs in the private sector, at least a million, to move more people from welfare to work. It's very important. And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more. There is not a more important issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "I still remember a woman that I met 10 years ago who said she wanted to get off welfare so her kids could tell—give an answer when they say, \"What does your mother do for a job?\" I met that woman again. She's got four kids. One's got a good job; one's studying to be a doctor; one's in technical school; one's an honor student in high school. I want to make more people like that woman, Lillie Harden. So I've got a plan to do it. And it's just beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, another thing we can do—we talk about growth—we've got a great economic package which I hope we'll discuss later: across the board tax cut; child credits, $500 per child under 18; reduce the capital gains rate; create more jobs and opportunities for people on and off welfare.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we have other provisions: less litigation. The trial lawyers—big supporters of the President—the trial lawyers, of course they like lawsuits, so every time they have a bill that they want vetoed, the President vetoes it for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've got to understand in America that we've got to have growth, create more jobs and more opportunities in the private sector. The President takes credit for all of these people off welfare—the Governors did that. Federal Government doesn't do that. And the Government doesn't create jobs, they're created in the private sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. This section, question? Yes, ma'am, on the back row. This is for the President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Capital Gains Tax\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. Mr. President, my name is Pamela Johnson, and I'm a landlord. My question is, does your party have any future plans to reduce the capital gains tax, especially for retired Americans?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. First of all, we have a big plan to reduce the capital gains tax when people sell their homes. Part of my tax package, which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains for people when they sell their home, which I think is the biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also have a capital gains now for people that invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for 5 years. It was part of our other economic plan. And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the most important thing to emphasize, though, is that we also have to help people in other ways to build a stronger economy. And we can't have any tax cut that's not paid for. One of the big differences between Senator Dole and myself is that I told you how I'm going to pay for every penny of the tax cuts I recommend. We've worked hard to bring this deficit down, and that's helped people in the real estate business, because the interest rates are lower. We've got homeownership at a 15year high. We've got this country going in the right direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we can have a tax cut, but my priority would be to help the families who need it with childrearing and education and buying a firsttime home and helping for health care costs. So from your business, helping in buying the first-time home, exempting the capital gains on the sale of the home would be the most important things that you asked about. Thank you, Pamela.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, Pamela, what the President didn't tell you is that all his tax cuts expire at the year 2000, but all his increases go on forever. That's the liberal approach. You know, give you a little tax cut, give you a couple of years, then make the tax increases go on forever. So the net tax increase in his plan is somewhere between $60 billion and $80 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have in the Dole-Kemp economic plan, unless your home is worth over $500,000—and if it is, I appreciate it, congratulate you—but in any event, no tax. And it's a good idea. They saw it, and they picked it up and put in theirs, but it's only temporary. Ours is permanent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ours is a good plan: create jobs and opportunities; capital gains rate, cut it in half, cut it from 28 percent to 14 percent. There are $7 trillion in assets locked up in America. If we cut the capital gains rate—I'm told every day— I got a letter from a former constituent in Kansas saying, \"I want to sell property in California, put it in my business in Kansas. I can't because the capital gains rate is too high.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to get the economy going. That will help Social Security. That will create more jobs. That will help people who want to get off welfare. It's the American way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Before Senator Dole left the Senate, he and Mr. Gingrich also were recommending that we pass these tax cuts only insofar as we could pay for them. And we all assume that the tax cuts will be permanent, but we have to prove we can pay for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "After he left the Senate, we abandoned that. That's why most experts say that this tax scheme will blow a huge hole in the deficit, raise interest rates, and weaken the economy. And that will take away all the benefits of the tax cut with a weaker economy. That's why we have to balance the budget. And I'll tell you how I'm going to pay for anything I promise you, line by line. You should expect that from both of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. All right. The next question is for Senator Dole. Yes, ma'am, right there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Responding to American Youth\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. My name is Melissa Lydeana, and I'm a third-year student out at UC-San Diego. And I just want to say that it's a great honor representing the voices of America. My question is concerning you, Mr. Dole, all the controversy regarding your age. How do you feel you can respond to young voices of America today and tomorrow?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, I think age is very—you know, wisdom comes from age, experience, and intelligence. And if you have some of each— and I have some age, some experience, some intelligence—[laughter]—that adds up to wisdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it also is a strength; it's an advantage. And I have a lot of young people work in my office, work in my campaign. This is about America. This is about—somebody said earlier, one of the first questions, we're together. It's one America, one nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm looking at our economic plan because I'm concerned about the future for young people. I'm looking about drugs. The President's been AWOL for 4 years. I'm looking about crime. He'll claim credit now for crime going down, but it happened because mayors and Governors and others have brought crime down. Rudy Giuliani, the mayor of New York, brought crime down 25 percent just in New York City, but of course the President will take credit for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "My view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education. This year the Republican Congress, as far as student loans, went from 24 billion to 36 billion over the next 6 years— a 50 percent increase; the highest appropriation ever, $6 billion for Pell grants. Very, very important. And we also raised the amount of each Pell grant.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our economic plan, the $500 child credit can be used for young people. Rolled over and over and over—of course, not this age, but if you have a child 2 years old, 7 percent interest, it would be worth about $18,000 by the time that child was ready for college.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. I can only tell you that I don't think Senator Dole is too old to be President. It's the age of his ideas that I question.\n",
      "\n",
      "You're almost not old enough to remember this, but we've tried this before, promising people an election-year tax cut that's not paid for——\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. We tried it last time you ran.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. ——telling you you can have everything you got—and let me just say this: Did you hear him say the Congress just voted to increase student loans and scholarships? They did, after he left. The last budget he led cut Pell grants, cut student loans. I vetoed it when they shut the Government down.\n",
      "\n",
      "My plan would give students a dollar-for-dollar reduction for the cost of the typical community college tuition, a $10,000 deduction a year for the cost of college tuition, would let families save in an IRA and withdraw tax-free to pay for the cost of education. And it's all paid for.\n",
      "\n",
      "My whole administration is about your future, it's about what the 21st century is going to be like for you. And I hope you'll look at the ideas in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, when you don't have any ideas, I guess you say the other person's ideas are old. As I said earlier, they don't have any ideas. Their idea is to raise taxes and spend more money. That's the liberal philosophy. If that's what you like, you've got a perfect candidate.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Clinton came to California in 1992 and said, \"The centerpiece in my first 4 years is going to be a middle class tax cut.\" Now, to all you who got that tax cut, congratulations, because you got a big tax increase. You got a $265 billion tax increase. And he stands here and says politicians who make promises like that ought to be ignored. Well, he made the promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "I keep my word, and you'll have a tax cut. It will help you in whatever you're going to do in the next few years. Thank you.\n",

      "Affirmative Action\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. Hello. My name is Chessie Sanders, and my question is do you feel that America has grown enough and has educated itself enough to totally cut out affirmative action?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. No, ma'am, I don't. I am against quotas; I'm against giving anybody any kind of preference for something they're not qualified for, but because I still believe that there is some discrimination and that not everybody has an opportunity to prove they are qualified, I favor the right kind of affirmative action.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've done more to eliminate programs—affirmative action programs that I didn't think were fair and to tighten others up than my predecessors have since affirmative action has been around, but I have also worked hard to give people a chance to prove that they are qualified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me just give you some examples. We've doubled the number of loans from the Small Business Administration, tripled the number of loans to women business people—no one unqualified. Everybody had to meet the standards. We've opened 260,000 new jobs in the military to women since I've been President, but the Joint Chiefs say we're stronger and more competent and solid than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me give you another example of what I mean. To me, affirmative action is making that extra effort. It's sort of like what Senator Dole did when he sponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act that said to certain stores, \"Okay, you've got to make it accessible to people with wheelchairs.\" We weren't guaranteeing anything—anybody anything except the chance to prove they were qualified, the chance to prove that they could do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's why I must say I agree with General Colin Powell that we're not there yet. We ought to keep making those extra-effort affirmative action programs the law and the policy of the land.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, we may not be there yet, but we're not going to get there by giving preferences and quotas. I supported that route for some time, and again, I think it gets back to experience—a little experience, a little age, a little intelligence. And I noticed that nobody was really benefiting except a very small group at the top. The average person wasn't benefiting. People who had the money were benefiting. People who got all the jobs were benefiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems to me that we ought to support the California civil rights initiative. It ought to be not based on gender or ethnicity or color or disability. I'm disabled. I shouldn't have a preference. I would like to have one in this race, come to think of it. But I don't get one. Maybe we can work that out. I get a 10-point spot. [Laughter]\n",
      "\n",
      "This is America. No discrimination. Discrimination ought to be punished, but there ought to be equal opportunity. We ought to reach out and make certain everybody has a chance to participate. Equal opportunity, but we cannot guarantee equal results in America. That's not how America became the greatest country on the face of the Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. I have never supported quotas. I've always been against them. They don't favor equal results. But I do favor making sure everybody has a chance to prove they're competent. The reason I have opposed that initiative is because I'm afraid it will end those extra-effort programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again I say think of the American with Disabilities Act. Make an effort to put a ramp up there so someone in a wheelchair can get up. You don't guarantee that they get the job; you guarantee they have a chance to prove they're competent.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as I've said, this is not a partisan thing with me. General Powell, Colin Powell said the same thing. He fears that the initiative would take away the extra-effort programs. No preferences to unqualified people, no quotas, but don't give up on making an extra effort till you're sure everybody has a chance to prove they're qualified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. All right, the next question is for Senator Dole, and it comes from this section right here. The back row, there, in the blue shirt. Yes, sir.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole's Tax Cut Proposal\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. My name's Tim David. I'm a mechanical engineer. Senator Dole, how do you reduce taxes and balance the budget?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Oh, I'm glad you asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. So am I. I am too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. What's your first name? Tim?\n",
      "\n",
      "I first want to say the President didn't quite give you all the stuff on quotas, because the Justice Department entered what we call the Piscataway case up in New Jersey. It's pretty clear that was a quota case. And just because one teacher was white and one teacher was black and they had the same qualification, you know, they decided who would stay there. It shouldn't be that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the President can say, well, he wants to mend it, not end it. There are 168 Federal programs that allow quotas. He ended one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now this economic package, Tim, I'm glad you asked because you look like the type that might be able to benefit from the 15 percent, across-the-board tax cut and $500-per-child tax credit or, you know, estate tax relief, which you're not interested in right now, but capital gains rate reduction—if you're taking care of an elderly parent, you get a $1,000 deduction. We think that's very important because a lot of people take care of their parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do we pay for it? We're going to have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, which the President opposed and defeated. He twisted arms, got six Democrats to vote with him. We lost by one vote. We're going to balance the budget by the year 2002.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President wants to spend 20 percent more over the next 6 years; I want to spend 14 percent more and give that 6 percent back to the people. Remember, it's your money. It's not his money, and it's not my money. It's your money, and you shouldn't have to apologize for wanting to keep all you can of it, but he ought to apologize for wanting to take more and more. He wants to give you sort of a Government tax cut which really doesn't mean anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. You know, one of the responsibilities of growing older, it seems to me, is being able to tell people something they may not want to hear just because it's truth. When they had a $250 billion tax scheme—that is half the size of this one, this one is 550—they passed a budget that had $270 billion in Medicare cuts, the first education cuts in history, cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent, took away the guarantee of quality standards in nursing homes, took away the guarantee of health care to folks with disabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't take my word for this. The Economist magazine polled lots of economists. Seven Nobel Prize winners have said, if this tax scheme passes, it will require huge cuts—40 percent— in the environment, in law enforcement, in education. It will require bigger cuts in Medicare than I vetoed last time. My targeted tax cut gives tax cuts for education, childrearing, buying a first-time home, paying for health care costs, and it's paid for. And I've told you how I'll pay for it. He won't tell you because he can't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Your targeted tax cut, Mr. President, never hits anybody. That's the problem with it. Nobody ever gets it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I must say I'm a little offended by this word \"scheme.\" You talked about—last time you talked about a risky scheme, and then Vice President Gore repeated it about 10 times in St. Petersburg. If I have anything in politics, it's my word. My colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, will tell you that Bob Dole kept his word. I'm going to keep my word to you. I'm going to keep my word to the American people.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're going to cut taxes and balance the budget. We're not going to touch Medicare. It's going to grow 39 percent, and Social Security is going to grow 34 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the President doesn't have any ideas so he's out trashing ours. This isn't going to blow a hole in the deficit. He promised you a tax cut in 1992, and if you got one, you ought to vote for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. Sir.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next question is for the President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, sir, right there—white shirt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Family and Medical Leave Act\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. My name is Dwayne Burns. I'm a martial arts instructor and a father. Mr. President, could you outline any plans you have to expand the family leave act?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, first let me say that I signed the family leave act. It was my very first bill, and I'm very proud of it because it symbolizes what I think we ought to be doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't take credit for all the good things that have happened in America, but I take credit for what I've tried to do to work with others to make good things happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most important good things that happen in America happen in families. Just about every family I know, the main concern is how am I going to succeed at work and still do right by my children? Family and medical leave has let 12 million families take a little time off for the birth of a child or a family illness without losing their job. I'd like to see it expanded in two ways: I'd like to say you can also take a little time off without losing your job to go to a regular parent-teacher conference or to go to a regular doctor's appointment with a family member; I'd also like to see the overtime laws change so that we could have some more flextime so that at the discretion of the worker— the worker—if you earn overtime you could decide whether you want that time to be taken in cash or in time with your family if you've got a family problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never go anywhere, it seems like, where I don't meet somebody who's benefited from the family leave law. In Longview, Texas, the other day, I met a woman who was almost in tears because she had been able to keep her job while spending time with her husband who had cancer. One of the people who's here with me today met a woman in the airport saying that her son just was able to be present at the birth of his child because of the family leave law.\n",
      "\n",
      "So yes, I think it should be expanded. We have to help people succeed at home and at work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, 88 percent of the people the President claims, or 11 million, are already covered. And only 5 percent—keep in mind, only 5 percent of the employers were even affected by the family leave act.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a better idea. We didn't win, but we had a better idea. Now we have a majority; we need to get a President. That was a tax credit to the employer. Instead of the Federal Government reaching out, we had a tax credit to pick up some of the cost, because if you have to hire a replacement worker, that's a cost. This is the way it ought to work. Give more power back to the States and back to the people, back to the taxpayers, not always the long arm of the Federal Government.\n",
      "\n",
      "But keep in mind this bill covers 5 percent of the employers; 95 percent of the employers and all those employees they employ are not covered in this act. And according to Investors Daily, which I read just a couple of days ago, 88 percent of the people he claims credit for were already covered in collective bargaining agreements or other agreements.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had family leave in our office. I'm certain—I see my friend Senator Mitchell. He had family leave. I work every day with people. I spent a lot of time in hospitals. I know what it's like to be in a hospital. Sure, we want family leave, but there's a better way to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. I only have 30 seconds. I can't fix the statistics. It covers the majority of the work force. Employers of under 50 are exempted. The bill originally covered employers of 25 and more, but because of opposition, we went up to 50. Senator Dole led the opposition to it. He filibustered it. He said it was a mistake. He said it would hurt the economy. We've had record numbers of new small businesses and 10 1/2 million jobs. It didn't hurt the economy. He still believes it's a mistake. I believe it was right. You can decide which of us you think are right. It's up to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. Next question for Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "This side. Yes, ma'am.\n",
      "\n",
      "Domestic Manufacturing\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. Hi. My name is Bridget Gianotti, and I'm a wife and mother of two sons from Carlsbad. And my question for you, Senator Dole, is as the wife of a San Diego business owner, I see one of our biggest problems is the U.S. does not manufacture enough of our own products. How would you help this problem out?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, right, we've lost 357,000 manufacturing jobs. And the Bureau of Labor Statistics said today that they made a mistake, it's probably going to be a much, much higher figure. So we're talking about all these new jobs, we'd better wait and see what the results are.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're going to do that with a more aggressive trade policy. We're going to do that with an economic package. We're going to do that with regulatory reform. You know, regulations cost the average family—right here, Democrat or Republican—about $7,000 a year—7,000. It's like a tax. Put a lot of people out of business.\n",
      "\n",
      "I met a lady in Colorado Springs about 7 weeks ago, now. She had a small business with 63 employees. She finally gave it up. Why? Because of paperwork and regulation. Congress passed the Paperwork Reduction Act. The President exempts the IRS, which creates threefourths of the paperwork.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're going to have regulatory—we're going to have litigation reform. You know, I fell off a platform out in California, in Chico, a while back. Before I hit the ground, my cell phone rang, and this trial lawyer says, \"I think we've got a case here.\" [Laughter] You know, we've got to stop some of these frivolous lawsuits. They're putting people out of business, men and women. Get the economy going, cut the capital gains rate, create more jobs and opportunities for everybody in America—that's what we will do, and my word is good. I keep my promises. I don't break my promises after the election, and I don't make new promises on an election year.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're going to get it done; we're going to grow some of these jobs in America because we need to get it. They're going the wrong way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Let's look at the facts. We lost a lot of manufacturing jobs in the 12 years before I became President. We've gained manufacturing jobs since I've been President. We've negotiated over 200 separate trade agreements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's just take California. In California, we made $37 billion worth of telecommunications equipment eligible for exports for the first time. We're selling everything from telephones to CD's to rice in Japan. We're selling American automobiles in Japan now. I visited a Chrysler dealership in Japan. We're number one in automobile manufacturing, production, and sales around the world again for the first time since the 1970's. Why? Because we've had tough, aggressive trade policies, and because we got interest rates down, and we had a good, stable economic policy, because we've reduced the deficit 4 years in a row for the first time in the 20th century that a President's done that in all 4 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's why I don't want to see us blow a big hole in the deficit with a tax program we can't pay for so your interest rates will go up and you'll have to pay back in higher interest rates what you allegedly will get in a tax cut.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I say keep working on expanding the markets. More than half of these 10 1/2 million new jobs were in higher wage areas, and we'll have more manufacturing and more sales at home and around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, you may think the biggest employer in America is General Motors, but I've got news for you. It's manpower services, hiring people temporarily who've lost their jobs and they go to work for 30 days or 60 days. That's a good economy? I don't think so. They're setting new records this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have the worst economy in a century. We have the slowest growth, about 2.5 percent. The President inherited a growth of over 5 percent. We don't have the S&L crisis anymore. Republicans have cut $53 billion in spending. That's why the budget can look good. It didn't look too good the first 2 years when we had a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. The next question is for President Clinton. Yes, sir?\n",
      "\n",
      "Gay Rights\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. I'm Bob Goldfarb. I'm a travel agent. And can you please explain your policy on the employment nondiscrimination act that would have prohibited discrimination, would have prohibited people from being fired from their jobs simply for being gay or lesbian?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. I'm for it. That's my policy. I'm for it. I believe that any law-abiding taxpaying citizen who shows up in the morning and doesn't break the law and doesn't interfere with his or her neighbors ought to have the ability to work in our country and shouldn't be subject to unfair discrimination. I'm for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I have a little time left, so let me just say that I get attacked so many times on these questions it's hard to answer all those things. In February—Senator Dole just said we had the worst economy in a century. In February he said we had the best economy in 30 years— just February. And I don't want to respond in kind to all these things. I could; I could answer a lot of these things tit for tat. But I hope we can talk about what we're going to do in the future. No attack ever created a job or educated a child or helped a family make ends meet. No insult ever cleaned up a toxic waste dump or helped an elderly person. Now, for 4 years that's what I've worked on. If you'll give me 4 years more, I'll work on it some more.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I'll try to answer these charges, but I prefer to emphasize direct answers to the future, and I gave you a direct answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. Senator Dole?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, I'm opposed to discrimination in any form, but I'm—but I don't favor creating special rights for any group. That would be my answer to this question. And I'm—you know, there'd be special rights for different groups in America, but I'm totally opposed to discrimination, don't have any policy against hiring anyone—whether it's lifestyle or whatever, we don't have any policy of that kind, never have had in my office, nor will we have in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as far as special rights, I'm opposed to same-sex marriages, which the President signed well after midnight one morning, in the dark of night—he opposed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'll get back to the economic package because again, I think this is very important. If there is anything that's going to change America, it's get the economy to grow. The President inherited a good economy—sure. The S&L crisis ended, we were selling assets, we had a Republican Congress cutting spending finally, and he says we've had the best 4 years ever. That's not true. We've had over 1.2 million bankruptcies—set a new record. Credit card debt has never been higher. I just told you about this manufacturing job loss which is going to increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need a good, strong economic package. Let the private sector create the jobs. And they can do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. Mr. President?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. If you believe that the California economy was better in 1992 than it is today, you should vote for Bob Dole. I have worked so hard out here to help turn this economy around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me just give you one tiny example. In San Diego, where we had some defense cutbacks, we funded a project with the University of California, San Diego to use airplane composite materials to build lighter, stronger bridges—\n",
      "\n",
      "a little project, and a program that Senator Dole opposed—and that composite now is going to be built around the bridges on the Santa Monica freeway to help minimize the impact of earthquakes and create more jobs. That's just one tiny example. Maybe we'll talk about some more before it's over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. The next question is for Senator Dole and it's from this section.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, ma'am? Yes?\n",
      "\n",
      "Health Care\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. Senator Dole, I am Verda Stratigus, and I work in health care. And it's truly an honor to be here tonight to address both of you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. Being in health care—we have talked a little bit about health care tonight, but mainly MediCal and Medicare have been mentioned, but the private sector is a problem. Managed care is taking over, especially in California, and because of that, the quality of care is going downhill. There are many, many people who cannot get the tests that they need when they need them. And because of that, they are dying needlessly. There are many, many more lawsuits being presented against the managed care industry because of this. And I think it's a real problem that needs to be addressed. What would you do if you were President?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, one thing I did was to oppose the Government takeover of health care that President Clinton offered in 1993, which created 17 new taxes and 50 new bureaucracies and price controls, because we were afraid the very thing you mentioned would have happened. Everybody would have been forced into managed care. You couldn't have chosen your own doctor. And that would have been the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I think right now we've got to go back— I know they've appointed a commission to take a look at managed care. Maybe that's part of the answer. But it seems to me, if we start to take choices away from people and if we drive them into one type care, if we eliminate fee-for-service altogether or eliminate the fact you can go to your own doctor, you've got to go somewhere else, then I think we've taken a giant step backward in the United States of America.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have the best health care delivery system in the world, and we want to keep it that way. That's why we opposed the Government takeover health care plan that President Clinton tried and tried and tried to get through Congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Didn't get it done. When it ended up we had more votes than he had, then they decided to pull the plug. It was a big, big mistake. Now, whether or not he'll do that again, I've heard some of the people say, \"Well, that's the model we ought to use.\" And if he's reelected, maybe he'll come back and try it again. I hope not. I hope not in both cases. But it does seem to me that you've raised a very important point that needs to be addressed. We're going to have to watch it, going to have to take a look at all the managed care going on in California, or we're going to end up losing our best care that we have in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. I'm just curious. How many of you are under managed care plans? Raise your hand if you're in managed care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Probably the young people here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. How many of you like it? Well——\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Two.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. One of the things that I tried to do was to make sure that everybody in the country who was under a managed care plan should at least have three choices of plans and would have the right to get out without penalty every year. Now, that's not a Government takeover, that's like the family and medical leave law. It just tries to set the rules of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm strongly in favor of a Federal bill to repeal the—any gag rules on providers. In other words, I believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need and what more expensive care options might be.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we're saving money and managing resources better, that's a good thing. If we're saving money and depriving people of care, that's a bad thing. A good place to start is to say no managed care provider can gag a doctor and kick the doctor out of the managed care plan for the doctor telling the patient, \"You need a more expensive test, you need a more expensive procedure. Your health requires it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. Senator Dole?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, I don't have any quarrel with that. I think that would help. But I think what we want to avoid is falling back into this nationalized health care system that President Clinton wanted to give us in 1993. If that isn't a liberal idea, I've never heard one: 17 new taxes; price controls; 50 new bureaucracies. We'd have that trouble all over America.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to deal with managed care. It not only happened in California, it's happening in other States that we visit too. It's a national problem, not just a State problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. The next question is for President Clinton, and in this section. Yes, ma'am. Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Participation in Electoral Process\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. All right, I'd sort of like to—Coleen O'Connor. I teach history and political science at San Diego Mesa College right up the road here. And I'd like to tee off from the original question by another teacher and speak for those people that aren't here tonight. Sixty-three percent of the American people are not participating, that are eligible to vote, not even participating in the process. Several parties can't even get into the debate: the Green Party, the Reform Party, the Natural Law Party. All of these people have basically opted out of what we're still participating in.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if we in fact are going to bring the country back together and be all faces around the table, the new American family, what do you see as something the President can do to begin that process to bring them back in?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. First of all, I think it's important to make voting more accessible. That's why I strongly supported the motor voter law. There was a big story, I think, in USA Today about the millions of people who've now registered because of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, I think we need to look at making the elections more accessible. You know, several States now are letting people vote over 3 weeks. A lot of people are busy, and it's hard for them to just get there and vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third thing I think we need is more forums like this, which is one of the reasons I have so strongly supported campaign finance reform, because if you want to cut the cost of campaigns, you have to open the airwaves, because what drives the cost of a campaign are the costs of advertising on television, radio, newspaper, mass mailing. And if you open the airwaves to more things like this—you see, it's not just you that are participating here. For every one of you who stood up here and asked a question tonight, I promise you, there's 100,000 Americans that said, \"I wish I could have asked that question.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I think we have to change the nature of politics. The last thing I think we should do is something I've been trying to do since I've been President, is every time I do something in a public way, I try to have a real American citizen there who is directly affected by it so that people can see the connection of what happens way across the country in Washington with more police on the street in San Diego, clean up the sewage here in San Diego, doubling the border guards here in southern California, that there is a connection between what we do way back there and what we do here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those are my best ideas about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, I don't know of any perfect solution. I've been in politics for some time, and I worry about people who don't vote. And I wonder if it's our fault, the candidates' fault. People say \"I don't care. One vote doesn't make a difference.\" I can give you hundreds of cases—you can probably give me 200 cases where one vote made a difference. I know it made a lot of difference many times in the Congress. Campaign finance might help, might help contributions coming in from Indonesia or other foreign countries, rich people in those countries, and then being sent back after the L.A. Times discovers it—$250,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "But maybe there ought to be more debates. I'd be willing to have another debate this year where we'd invite all of the candidates and talk about the economy. If we don't get the economy to grow, if we don't cut taxes, and give people child credits, and cut the capital gains rate, and get this economy growing, we're going to limp into the next century. If we grow the economy, it's going to help Social Security, it's going to help jobs, it's going to help everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Let me make one other suggestion. As you're a teacher, you can have an impact on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the things I think that really frustrates people is that so often, political campaigns seem to be more about the politicians that are running than the people. Now, there is a connection, and I think what we have to do is convince people there's a big difference. If you vote one way, you will have a Department of Education in the 21st century; if you vote the other way, you won't. If you vote one way, you'll have an expansion of family leave; if you vote the other way, you'll be lucky to save it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But these are important questions, and people have to decide. I think that the American people also need to be a little more responsible and think about whether there's a connection in their lives and what we do in Washington.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. For Senator Dole, in this section. On the back row, yes, ma'am.\n",
      "\n",
      "Social Security and Alternatives\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. I'm Iris Seiffert, and I'm unemployed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Iris?\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. Iris. Senator Dole, we talked about Social Security for us baby boomers, but shouldn't we be saving and investing for our own retirement as well? Are you planning any incentives to encourage us to take care of ourselves rather than to rely on the Government and on Social Security when we retire?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, we have in our economic pack individual retirement accounts where we think it'll encourage savings. You could also use those accounts for health care or education or a first home. We're doing that precisely. And I think one thing sooner or later we're going to have to consider is to take a look at the Social Security system, because we've got a lot of people advocating that, well, we don't want to put our money into Social Security. Now, you've got to be very careful about that, because you have to protect the people who are already in the pipeline. But it's something you might consider. I'm not suggesting it will be done, but at least we ought to look at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been looked—when I was chairman of the Finance Committee, which handles Social Security, we looked at all these options, and one thing we've got to make certain—when I used to go home, my mother would tell me, \"All I've got is my Social Security; don't touch it.\" And we didn't touch it. We preserved it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I'm an optimist. Your Social Security is going to be there when you retire. We'll fix it. It will probably happen in the year 2012 or 2015. In 1983, we thought we had a 75year fix. It didn't work—much, much less. But at least we fixed it for some time, and 37 to 40 million people get their checks on time.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we need to preserve the system, and we need to make it stronger. But we also need to look at some options whether or not we— it would depend on what the options are. In fact, they've got a commission right now in Congress, a bipartisan commission, looking at all the different options they're going to present to the next Congress. So I think we'll wait and see what they present, take a look at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. This is one where we have some agreement, I think. Only about half the people in this country have pension plans, and Social Security is not enough for a lot of people to live on, or at least it's not enough for them to maintain anything like their previous lifestyle. So we've got to figure out how we're going to have more people with pension plans. And pension coverage has been declining as more and more people work for small businesses and fewer people work for big businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what is in my plan—and I think it's almost identical to what's in Senator Dole's plan—is we make more people than are now eligible to save in an IRA, and we'd let couples—married couples save more, and then they could withdraw from it tax-free if they needed to for medical emergencies or to buy a home or for an education, but they could also save to supplement their retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to that, we just passed a sweeping small business reform that makes it easier for small-business people to take out 401(k) plans for themselves and their employees and then much easier for employees to carry it from job to job. My best friend from grade school is a computer software salesman, and he told me last time he changed employers it took him 9 months to figure out how to transfer his 401(k) plan. Now, none of that will happen anymore. And so I hope that over the next 10 years you'll see a big increase in the percentage of people that have pension plans plus a secure Social Security System.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Did you say you're unemployed? The first thing we ought to do is get you a job. And that's the economic package again: Create jobs and opportunities, reduce the capital gains rate, reduce regulatory reform, stop some of this senseless litigation, and let people work in America. And I think that's the thrust we will make.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, Social Security is a very important program. It'll be preserved—Democrats or Republicans. It'll be preserved. We want to make certain we protect those in the pipeline, just as we did back in 1983. And we did it on a bipartisan basis. We took it out of politics. People get so tired of politics. And we ought to do the same with Medicare. Maybe we could make a deal here tonight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. All right, the question is for President Clinton. Does anybody have a foreign affairs question in this section? Yes, sir.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trade With Japan\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. Good evening. I'm Michael Smith. I'm an electronics technician in the Navy. My question was how you plan to deal with the trade deficit with Japan?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Let me tell you what we have done. We have concluded with Japan 21, about to be 22 trade agreements now. And since we did that, in the areas where we concluded trade agreements, our exports to Japan have gone up by 85 percent in the last 4 years, and our trade deficit with Japan has gone down. Until about 5 months ago, the Japanese economy was in a deep recession. It's coming back now, so they can buy even more American products, and I think it'll go down more.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm very—that's one of the real success stories here of the work we've done. We're selling Japanese rice from California for the first time. I visited a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo. I visited a Jeep plant, the oldest auto plant in America, in Toledo, Ohio, where they're going to export 41,000 right-hand-drive Jeeps this year, and they've got 700 new jobs because of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no easy way to do this. When you're dealing with an economy that's traditionally been more closed and one that's traditionally been more open, you just have to gut it out issue by issue by issue. We agreed in principle on our insurance agreement, and we're working on three or four other areas now. But the way you have to do it is make sure you're competitive—we're the most competitive country in the world now—and then just fight to open those markets and go try to make the sale. And that's what our trade ambassador, our Commerce Secretary, and all the other people in our administration have tried to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. Senator?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, the bottom line is we've got to stop exporting jobs. We need to keep jobs here. I said there are 357,000 good jobs, manufacturing jobs, which were lost. And I assume some of those because of our trading partners; we didn't have access to their markets. We ought to insist on access. If we don't have access to their markets the same way they have access to our markets, we ought to say, \"Wait, that's enough. Time out. When you give us access, we'll give you access.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's very hard to get into the Japanese market, as everybody knows. They want to get into our market. They sell a lot of automobiles here, create a lot of jobs—those who sell exports. And it's very important to the economy. But I think we want to make certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "I supported the President's trade policy, but we've got to be more aggressive. Once you have a policy, then you've got to go out and be aggressive and enforce that policy. There are American jobs that are being lost. This is what Ross Perot complains about. And I'd say to the Reform Party, take a look at the Republican Party. We're the reform party, and we're going to make things better. And one of the things we're going to do is stop exporting jobs in America.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Let me say again, we've had over 200 separate trade agreements in the last 4 years, by far the largest number in American history, not just the big ones you've read about but a lot of smaller ones. And now what we have to do is to focus on those things we're real good at and make sure we're getting a fair deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "We just had a pretty serious dispute with China because they were copying our CD's and costing thousands of jobs in places like California. But we said, \"You know, if you want to keep doing business and selling your products over here, you're going to have to quit pirating our CD's.\" And they agreed to do a number of things and to let us verify that they'd done it. But I think they're going to make the problem much better.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is not a simple, easy answer. You just have to work on this day-in and day-out, every month, every year, every issue to make sure that we have not only free trade but fair trade. I'm proud that we're better off on that than we were 4 years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. All right, the next question is for Senator Dole, and it's in this section. Yes, sir.\n",
      "\n",
      "Religion and Values\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. Ron Kite, minister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Hi, Ron.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. This great Nation has been established by the Founding Fathers, who possessed very strong Christian beliefs and godly principles. If elected President of the United States, what could you do to return this Nation to these basic principles? And also, do you feel that the office of the President has the responsibility to set the role example to inspire our young people?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, no doubt about it, our Founding Fathers had a great deal of wisdom. And in addition to what you mentioned, they also were concerned about this all-powerful central Government in Washington, DC, that would in effect confiscate your property. So I carry around in my pocket—I can't pull it out, I'd violate the rules—a copy of the 10th amendment, which says that we ought to return power to the States and power to the people—people here. You ought to make more decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honor, duty, and country: that's what America is all about. Certainly the President of the United States, in the highest office in the world, the most important office in the world, has a responsibility to young people, as we talked about earlier—to everyone, by example. And when it comes to public ethics, he has a responsibility. When you have 30-some in your administration who've either left or are being investigated or in jail or whatever, then you've got an ethical problem. It's public ethics—I'm not talking about private, we're talking about public ethics—when you have 900 files gathered up by some guy who was a bouncer in a bar and hired as a security officer to collect files. In Watergate, I know a person who went to jail for looking at one file, one FBI file. There are 900 sequestered in the White House—900— people like you. Why should they be rifling through your files?\n",
      "\n",
      "So the President has a great responsibility. And it's one that I understand and would certainly carry out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. This is the most religious great country in history, and yet, interestingly enough, we have the most religious freedom of any country in the world, including the freedom not to believe. And now we have all these people— just up the road in Los Angeles County we've got people from 150 different racial and ethnic groups, and they've got tons of different religions. But the fundamental tenets of virtually every religion are the same. And what I've tried to do is to support policies that would respect religion, and then help parents inculcate those values to their children. Let me very briefly give you some examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my proudest moments was signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which says the Government's got to bend over backwards before we interfere with religious practice. So I changed a Justice Department effort to get a church to pay back a man's tithe because he was bankrupt when he gave it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've supported character education programs in our schools, drug-free schools programs. I've supported giving parents a V-chip on their television so if they don't want their young kids to watch things they shouldn't watch, they wouldn't have to. That's the kind of thing we need to do, give people like you and our families the power to give those values to our children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, I think it's—you know, before I came in tonight, my wife and daughter and I had a prayer because if it's God's will, whatever happens—if it's God's will, it will happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "A constitutional amendment for voluntary prayer in school in my view would be a great idea. I support it, and the President opposes it. I mean, it seems to me the President, whoever the President may be, this is one of his highest responsibilities. People look to the President of the United States more than any other person in America. And that's the way it's always been, and that's the way it always will be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. All right, this is our last question. It goes to President Clinton, and it's from this section.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, ma'am?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Special Rights\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. My name is Evette Duby, and I too am a minister; I'm with the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Clinton, perhaps you can help me with something tonight. I've heard Mr. Dole say several times, \"all of us together.\" And when he was asked if he would support equal rights in employment for gay and lesbian people, you said that you favored that, and he said that he did not believe in special rights. And I thought the question was equal rights for all people, and I don't understand why people are using the term \"special rights\" when the question is equal rights. Could you help me in understanding that?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. I want to answer your question, but let me say one other thing. We don't need a constitutional amendment for kids to pray. And what I did was to have the Justice Department and the Education Department, for the first time ever, issue a set of guidelines that we gave to every school in America saying that children could not be interfered with in religious advocacy, when they were praying, when they were doing whatever they could do under the Constitution just because they were on a public school grounds. And I think anyone who has experienced this would tell you that our administration has done more than any in 30 years to clarify the freedom of religion in the public square, including in the public schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I think I have to let Senator Dole speak for himself. It wouldn't be fair for me to do that. I would wind up—I mean, it's the last question, and I'd mischaracterize it to try to make you happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me tell you what I feel. We have a lot of differences in our country, and some of us believe that other people's decisions are wrong, even immoral. But under our Constitution, if you show up tomorrow and obey the law, and you work hard, and you do what you are supposed to do, you're entitled to equal treatment. That's the way the system works.\n",
      "\n",
      "All over the world, people are being torn apart—Bosnia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Burundi, you name it—because of all their differences. We still have some of that hatred inside us; you see it in the church burnings. And one of the things I've tried hardest to do is to tell the American people that we have to get beyond that, we have to understand that we're stronger when we unite around shared values instead of being divided by our differences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. Senator Dole?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, I hope I made my answer clear. I said I'm opposed to discrimination. You know, we've suffered discrimination in the disability community. There are 43 million of us. And I can recall cases where people would cross the street rather than meet somebody in a wheelchair.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we want to end discrimination. I think that answers itself. No discrimination in America. We've made that clear. And I would just say that it seems to me that that's the way it ought to be. We shouldn't discriminate—race, color, whatever, lifestyle, disability. This is America, and we're all proud of it. But we're not there yet. What we need is good, strong leadership going into the next century.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm sorry we didn't have a foreign policy question, because just this week Secretary Christopher said, \"Well, we really didn't know much the first couple of years about foreign policy.\" Now, that was quite an admission. It underscores what I had to say in the Hartford debate, that there is really no foreign policy in this administration. It's sort of ad hoc: \"Whatever comes up, we'll deal with it.\" Unfortunately, we didn't have more questions on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Let me say again, there is no more important responsibility for the President than to say, \"If you believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, that's all we need to know. And you can be part of our America, and you can walk across that bridge to the 21st century with us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And we are not well served when we attack each other in a kind of an ad hominem way. It doesn't create jobs. It doesn't educate children. It doesn't solve problems. We need to be disagreeing on ideas honestly and talking about the future. The future will be the greatest time in this country's history if we can beat this division that is bedeviling the whole rest of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Closing Statements\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. All right. Now we go to the closing statements. Senator Dole, you're first. Two minutes, sir.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole. Well, let me thank everybody here at the university, and Jim, thank you, all the people who may still be watching or viewing. This is what it's all about. It's not about me. It's not about President Clinton. It's about the process. It's about selecting a President of the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we have our differences. We should have our differences. I mentioned other parties. They have their differences. If we all agreed, it'd be a pretty dull place. We should have more debates. Maybe we'll have another debate on the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I would just say this: This is the highest honor that I have ever had in my life, to think that somebody from Russell, Kansas, somebody who grew up living in a basement apartment, somebody whose parents didn't finish high school, somebody who spent about 39 months in hospitals after World War II, somebody who uses a buttonhook every day to get dressed, somebody who understands that there are real Americans out there with real problems, whether soccer moms or the single parents or families working or seniors or people with disabilities, whoever it may be.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there are some very fundamental differences in this campaign. President Clinton opposes term limits. President Clinton opposes a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. President Clinton opposes a voluntary prayer amendment. He opposes an amendment to protect the flag of the United States of America. People give their lives—a couple of servicemen here—they sacrifice, they give everything for America. We ought to protect the American flag with a constitutional amendment.\n",
      "\n",
      "But beyond that, we need to address the economy. And I would just say, with my time running out here, it's a very proud moment for me. And what I want the voters to do is to make a decision. And I want them to be proud of their vote in the years ahead, proud that they voted for the right candidate, proud that they voted, hopefully, for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I'll just make you one promise. My word is good. Democrats and Republicans have said Bob Dole's word is good. I keep my word. I promise you, the economy is going to get better, we're going to have a good economic package, and we're going into the next century a better America.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President. Thank you, Jim. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and all the people who are watching.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing I'd like to say is I agree with what Senator Dole said. It's a remarkable thing in a country like ours that a man who grew up in Russell, Kansas, and one who was born to a widowed mother in Hope, Arkansas, could wind up running for President, could have a chance to serve as President. So the first thing I want to say is thank you for giving me the chance to be President.\n",
      "\n",
      "This election is about two different visions about how we should go into the 21st century. Would we be better off—as I believe—working together to give each other the tools we need to make the most of our God-given potential, or are we better off saying, \"You're on your own\"? Would we be better off building that bridge to the future together so we can all walk across it, or saying, \"You can get across yourself\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you don't leave this room with anything else tonight and if the people watching us don't leave with anything else, I hope you'll leave with this: This is a real important election. The world is changing dramatically in how we work and how we live, how we relate to each other— huge changes. And the decisions we make will have enormous practical consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we've talked about our responsibilities tonight. I want to talk about your responsibility and your responsibility. Your responsibility is to show up on November 5th, because you're going to decide whether we're going to balance the budget now but protect Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment. You'll decide whether we're going to keep fighting crime with the Brady bill, the assault weapons, and finish putting those 100,000 police; whether we're going to move a million people from welfare to work; whether we're going to give our families more protection for their kids against drugs and tobacco and gangs and guns; whether we're going to give our children world-class education where every 8-year-old can read, every 12-yearold can log in on the Internet, every 18-yearold can go to college.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we do those things, we'll build that bridge to the 21st century, and the greatest country in history will be even greater.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer. Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "This concludes—this is the last of the three 1996 Presidential and Vice Presidential debates.\n",
      "MRS. HINERFELD. Good evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm Ruth Hinerfeld of the League of Women Voters Education Fund. Next Tuesday is election day.

      "\n",
      "The ground rules for this, as agreed by you gentlemen, are these: Each panelist down here will ask a question, the same question, to each of the two candidates. After the two candidates have answered, a panelist will ask followup questions to try to sharpen the answers. The candidates will then have an opportunity each to make a rebuttal. That will constitute the first half of the debate, and I will state the rules for the second half later on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some other rules: The candidates are not permitted to bring prepared notes to the podium, but are permitted to make notes during the debate.

      "Now, based on a toss of the coin, Governor Reagan will respond to the first question from Marvin Stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "QUESTIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "U.S. ARMED FORCES\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. STONE. Governor, as you're well aware, the question of war and peace has emerged as a central issue in this campaign in the give-and-take of recent weeks. President Carter's been criticized for responding late to aggressive Soviet impulses, for insufficient buildup of our Armed Forces, and a paralysis in dealing with Afghanistan and Iran. You have been criticized for being all too quick to advocate the use of lots of muscle, military action, to deal with foreign crises. Specifically, what are the differences between the two of you on the uses of American military power?\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. I don't know what the differences might be, because I don't know what Mr. Carter's policies are. I do know what he has said about mine. And I'm only here to tell you that I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace, and that use of force is always and only a last resort, when everything else has failed, and then only with regard to our national security.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I believe, also that this meeting, this mission, this responsibility for preserving the peace, which I believe is a responsibility peculiar to our country, that we cannot shirk our responsibility as the leader of the Free World, because we're the only one that can do it. And therefore, the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us. And to maintain that peace requires strength. America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong. We can get into a war by letting events get out of hand, as they have in the last 3Â¼ years under the foreign policies of this administration of Mr. Carter's, until we're faced each time with a crisis. And good management in preserving the peace requires that we control the events and try to intercept before they become a crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have seen four wars in my lifetime. I'm a father of sons; I have a grandson. I don't ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into sandy beachheads in the Pacific, or rice paddies and jungles in Asia, or the muddy, bloody battlefields of Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Mr. Stone, do you have a followup question for the Governor?\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. STONE. Yes. Governor, we've been hearing that the defense buildup that you would associate yourself with would cost tens of billions of dollars more than is now contemplated. In assuming that the American people are ready to bear this cost, they nevertheless keep asking the following question: How do you reconcile huge increases in military outlays with your promise of substantial tax cuts and of balancing the budget, which in this fiscal year, the one that just ended, ran more than $60 billion in the red?\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. Mr. Stone, I have submitted an economic plan that I've worked out in concert with a number of fine economists in this country, all of whom approve it, and believe that over a 5-year projection, this plan can permit the extra spending for needed refurbishing of our defensive posture, that it can provide for a balanced budget by 1983, if not earlier, and that we can afford-along with the cuts that I have proposed in Government spending — we can afford the tax cuts I have proposed — and probably, mainly because Mr. Carter's economic policy has built into the next 5 years, and on beyond that, a tax increase that will be taking $86 billion more next year out of the people's pockets than was taken this year. And my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that $86 billion increase. I'm only reducing the amount of the increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, what I'm talking about is not putting Government back to getting less money than Government's been getting, but simply cutting the increase in spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. The same question now goes to President Garter. President Carter, would you like to have the question repeated?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. STONE. Yes, President Carter, the question of war and peace, a central issue in this campaign. You've been criticized in the give-and-take for responding late to aggressive Soviet impulses, for an insufficient buildup of our Armed Forces, and a paralysis in dealing with Afghanistan and Iran. Governor Reagan, on the other hand, has been criticized for being all too quick to advocate the use of lots of muscle, military action, to deal with foreign crises such as I mentioned. Specifically, what are the differences between the two of you on the uses of American military power?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. Mr. Stone, I've had to make thousands of decisions since I've been President, serving in the Oval Office. And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process. I think I'm a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated 4 years ago against President Ford. I've also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions. H. L. Mencken said that for every problem there's a simple answer. It would be neat and plausible — and wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact is that this Nation, in the 8 years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased. Seven out of eight years, the budget commitments for defense went down, 37 percent, in all. Since I've been in office, we've had a steady, carefully planned, methodical but very effective increase in our commitment for defense.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what we've done is to use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace. We've not only kept peace for our own country, but we've been able to extend the benefits of peace to others. In the Middle East, we've worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, successfully, and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability. This is a very good step forward for our Nation's security, and we'll continue to do as we've done in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature. There are always troublespots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President, alone in that Oval Office, affects our Nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests. That is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently by every President who serves. That's what I've tried to do, successfully, by keeping our country at peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Mr. Stone, do you have a followup on —\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. STONE. Yes. I would like to be a little more specific on the use of military power, and let's talk about one area for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under what circumstances would you use military forces to deal with, for example, a shutoff of Persian Oil Gulf, if that should occur, or to counter Russian expansion beyond Afghanistan into either Iran or Pakistan? I ask this question in view of charges that we are woefully unprepared to project sustained — and I emphasize the word \"sustained\" — power in that part of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. Mr. Stone, in my State of the Union address earlier this year, I pointed out that any threat to the stability or security of the Persian Gulf would be a threat to the security of our own country. In the past, we've not had an adequate military presence in that region. Now we have two major carrier task forces. We have access to facilities in five different areas of that region. And we've made it clear that working with our allies and others, that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in doing this, we have made sure that we address this question peacefully, not injecting American military forces into combat, but letting the strength of our Nation be felt in a beneficial way. This, I believe, has assured that our interests will be protected in the Persian Gulf region, as we've done in the Middle East and throughout the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Governor Reagan, you have a minute to comment or rebut.\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. Well, yes, I question the figure about the decline in defense spending under the two previous administrations, in the preceding 8 years to this administration. I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those 8 years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace. I also would like to point out that Republican Presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both Houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Gerald Ford left a 5-year projected plan for a military buildup to restore our defenses, and President Garter's administration reduced that by 38 percent, cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program that had been proposed, and stopped the B-1, delayed the cruise missile, stopped the production line for the Minuteman missiles, delayed the Trident submarine, and now is planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots in the world — which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one that is quick to look for use of force.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. President Carter, you have the last word on this question.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. Well, there are various elements of defense. One is to control nuclear weapons, which I hope we'll get to later on, because that's the most important single issue in this campaign. Another one is how to address troubled areas of the world. I think, habitually, Governor Reagan has advocated the injection of military forces into troubled areas, when I and my predecessors both Democrats and Republicans — have advocated resolving those troubles and those difficult areas of the world peacefully, diplomatically, and through negotiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to that, the buildup of military forces is good for our country, because we've got to have military strength in order to preserve the peace. But I'll always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat, and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle. Strength is imperative for peace, but the two must go hand in hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Thank you, gentlemen. The next question is from Harry Ellis to President Carter.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE NATION'S ECONOMY\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. ELLIS. Mr. President, when you were elected in 1976, the Consumer Price Index stood at 4.8 percent. It now stands at more than 12 percent. Perhaps more significantly, the Nation's broader, underlying inflation rate has gone up from 7 to 9 percent. Now, a part of that was due to external factors beyond U.S. control, notably the more than doubling of oil prices by OPEC last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the United States remains vulnerable to such external shocks, can inflation in fact be controlled? If so, what measures would you pursue in a second term?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. Again it's important to put the situation into perspective. In 1974 we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree. We had an even worse oil shock in 1979. In 1974 we had the worst recession, the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War. The recession that resulted this time was the briefest we've had since the Second World War.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, we've brought down inflation. Earlier this year, the first quarter, we did have a very severe inflation pressure, brought about by the OPEC price increase. It averaged about 18 percent the first quarter of this year. The second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13 percent. The most recent figures, the last 3 months, or the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7 percent — still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs — 9 million new jobs in the last 3 1/2 years — that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us.\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed that Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30-percent inflation rate. And Business Week, which is not a Democratic publication, said that this Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal — and I quote them, I think-was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this Nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature. So, to add 9 million new jobs, to control inflation, and to plan for the future with the energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Mr. Ellis, do you have a followup question for Mr. Carter?\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. ELLIS. Yes, Mr. President. You have mentioned the creation of 9 million new jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. ELLIS. At the same time, the unemployment rate still hangs high, as does the inflation rate. Now, I wonder, can you tell us what additional policies you would pursue in a second administration in order to try to bring down that inflation rate? And would it be an act of leadership to tell the American people they're going to have to sacrifice to adopt a leaner lifestyle for some time to come?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. Yes. We have demanded that the American people sacrifice, and they've done very well. As a matter of fact, we're importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago. We've had a 25-percent reduction since the first year I was in office. At the same time, as I said earlier, we have added about 9 million net new jobs in that period of time — a record never before achieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One, conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well — more coal this year than ever before in history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs — about a million in the next 2 years. And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people. This has already passed the House; now has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Now, the same question goes to Governor Reagan. Governor Reagan, would you like to have the question repeated?\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes, please.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. ELLIS. Governor Reagan, during the past 4 years, the Consumer Price Index has risen from 4.8 percent to currently over 12 percent. And perhaps more significantly, the Nation's broader, underlying rate of inflation has gone up from 7 to 9 percent. Now, a part of that has been due to external factors beyond U.S. control, and notably, the more than doubling of OPEC oil prices last year, which leads me to ask you whether, since the United States remains vulnerable to such external shocks, can inflation in fact be controlled? If so, specifically what measures would you pursue?\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country, that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious, and it's dangerous to say this to the people. When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4.8 percent, as you said. It had been cut in two by President Gerald Ford. It is now running at 12.7 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Carter also has spoken of the new jobs created. Well, we always, with the normal growth in our country and increase in population, increase the number of jobs. But that can't hide the fact that there are 8 million men and women out of work in America today, and 2 million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months. Mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation. And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, he has blamed to the people for inflation, OPEC, he's blamed the Federal Reserve System, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less. We don't have inflation because the people are living too well. We have inflation because the Government is living too well.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the last statement, just a few days ago, was a speech to the effect that we have inflation because Government revenues have not kept pace with Government spending. I see my time is running out here. I'll have to get this down very fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of Government to the place that we have balanced budgets and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in. And my economic plan calls for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President's economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way. But we'll have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. A followup, Mr. Ellis?\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. ELLIS. Yes, you have centered on cutting Government spending in what you have just said about your own policies. You have also said that you would increase defense spending. Specifically, where would you cut Government spending if you were to increase defense spending and also cut taxes, so that, presumably, Federal revenues would shrink?\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. Well, most people, when they think about cutting Government spending, they think in terms of eliminating necessary programs or wiping out something, some service that Government is supposed to perform. I believe that there is enough extravagance and fat in Government. As a matter of fact, one of the Secretaries of HEW under Mr. Carter testified that he thought there was $7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it. We've had the General Accounting Office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone, and they have added that waste adds even more to that.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a program for a gradual reduction of Government spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made. I'm confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation, because I did it in California. And inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned money to the people and reduced government spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. President Carter.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. Governor Reagan's proposal, the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, is one of the most highly inflationary ideas that ever has been presented to the American public. He would actually have to cut Government spending by at least $130 billion in order to balance the budget under this ridiculous proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed that his task force that's working for his future plans had some of their ideas revealed in the Wall Street Journal this week. One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year, Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage. This is a heartless kind of approach to the working families of our country which is typical of many Republican leaders in the past, but I think has been accentuated under Governor Reagan.\n",
      "\n",
      "In California — I'm surprised Governor Reagan brought this up — he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that State under his administration. He more than doubled State spending while he was Governor — 122-percent increase — and had between a 20- and 30-percent increase in the number of employees —\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Sorry to interrupt —\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. — in California.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. — Mr. Carter.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. Thank you, sir.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Governor Reagan has the last word on this question.\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes. The figures that the President has just used about California is a distortion of the situation there, because while I was Governor of California, our spending in California increased less per capita than the spending in Georgia while Mr. Carter was Governor of Georgia in the same 4 years. The size of government increased only onesixth in California of what it increased in proportion to population in Georgia.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the idea that my tax-cut proposal is inflationary: I would like to ask the President, why is it inflationary to let the people keep more of their money and spend it the way they'd like, and it isn't inflationary to let him take that money and spend it the way he wants?\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. I wish that question need not be rhetorical, but it must be because we've run out of time on that. [Laughter] Now, the third question to Governor Reagan from William Hilliard.\n",
      "\n",
      "URBAN POLICIES\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. HILLIARD. Yes, Governor Reagan, the decline of our cities has been hastened by the continual rise in crime, strained race relations, the fall in the quality of public education, the persistence of abnormal poverty in a rich nation, and a decline in the services to the public. The signs seem to point toward a deterioration that could lead to the establishment of a permanent underclass in the cities. What, specifically, would you do in the next 4 years to reverse this trend?\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. I have been talking to a number of Congressmen who have much the same idea that I have, and that is that in the inner-city areas, that in cooperation with local government and with National Government, and using tax incentives and with cooperation with the private sector, that we have development zones. Let the local entity, the city, declare this particular area, based on the standards of the percentage of people on welfare, unemployed, and so forth, in that area. And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The elements of government through these tax incentives for example, a business that would not have, for a period of time, an increase in the property tax reflecting its development of the unused property that it was making wouldn't be any loss to the city, because the city isn't getting any tax from that now. And there would simply be a delay, and on the other hand, many of the people that would then be given jobs are presently wards of the Government, and it wouldn't hurt to give them a tax incentive, because that wouldn't be costing Government anything either.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think there are things to do in this regard. I stood in the South Bronx on the exact spot that President Carter stood on in 1977. You have to see it to believe it. It looks like a bombed-out city — great, gaunt skeletons of buildings, windows smashed out, painted on one of them \"Unkept promises,\" on another, \"Despair.\" And this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was going to bring in a vast program to rebuild this area. There are whole blocks of land that are left bare, just bulldozed down flat, and nothing has been done. And they are now charging to take tourists through there to see this terrible desolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I talked to a man just briefly there who asked me one simple question: \"Do I have reason to hope that I can someday take care of my family again? Nothing has been done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Follow-up, Mr. Hilliard?\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. HILLIARD. Yes, Governor Reagan. Blacks and other nonwhites are increasing in numbers in our cities. Many of them feel that they are facing a hostility from whites that prevents them from joining the economic mainstream of our society. There is racial confrontation in the schools, on jobs, and in housing, as nonwhites seek to reap the benefits of a free society. What do you think is the Nation's future as a multiracial society?\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. I believe in it. I am eternally optimistic, and I happen to believe that we've made great progress from the days when I was young and when this country didn't even know it had a racial problem. I know those things can grow out of despair in an inner city, when there's hopelessness at home, lack of work, and so forth. But I believe that all of us together — and I believe the Presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was; it's a bully pulpit — and I think that something can be done from there, because the goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us — ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be — that we will have total equal opportunity for all people. And I would do everything I could in my power to bring that about.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Mr. Hilliard, would you repeat your question for President Carter?\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. HILLIARD. President Carter, the decline of our cities has been hastened by the continual rise in crime, strained race relations, the fall in the quality of public education, the persistence of abnormal poverty in a rich nation, and a decline in services to the public. The signs seem to point toward a deterioration that could lead to the establishment of a permanent underclass in the cities. What, specifically, would you do in the next 4 years to reverse this trend?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. Thank you, Mr. Hilliard.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was campaigning in 1976, everywhere I went the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our Nation. We initiated a very fine urban renewal program, working with the mayors, the Governors, and other interested officials. This has been a very successful effort. That's one of the main reasons that we've had such an increase in the number of people employed. Of the 9 million people put to work in new jobs since I've been in office, 1.3 million of those has been among black Americans and another million among those who speak Spanish.\n",
      "\n",
      "We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit. Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country. We also are pursuing housing programs. We've had a 73-percent increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education. These are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders, particularly in the minority areas of the central cities that had been deteriorating so rapidly in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens. I've brought into the top levels of Government — into the White House, into administrative offices of the executive branch, into the judicial system — highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed that Governor Reagan said that when he was a younger man that there was no knowledge of a racial problem in this country. Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem. We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. A followup question?\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. HILLIARD. Yes, President Carter, I'd like to repeat the same followup to you. Blacks and other nonwhites are increasing in numbers in our cities. Many of them feel that they are facing a hostility from whites that prevents them from joining the economic mainstream of our society. There is racial confrontation in the schools, on jobs, and in housing, as nonwhites seek to reap the benefits of a free society. What is your assessment of the Nation's future in a multiracial society?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. Ours is a nation of refugees, a nation of immigrants. Almost all of our citizens came here from other lands and now have hopes, which are being realized, for a better life, preserving their ethnic commitments, their family structures, their religious beliefs, preserving their relationships with their relatives in foreign countries, but still forming themselves together in a very coherent society, which gives our Nation its strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, those minority groups have often been excluded from participation in the affairs of government. Since I've been President, I've appointed, for instance, more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous Presidents in the history of this country. I've done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans. To involve them in administration of government and a feeling that they belong to the societal structure that makes decisions in the judiciary and in executive branch is a very important commitment which I am trying to realize and will continue to do so in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Governor Reagan, you have a minute for rebuttal.\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes. The President talks of Government programs, and they have their place. But as Governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end. They were public employment for these people who really want to get out into the private job market, where there are jobs with a future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the President spoke a moment ago about — that I was against the minimum wage. I wish he could have been with me when I sat with a group of teenagers who were black and who were telling me about their unemployment problems, and that it was the minimum wage that had done away with the jobs that they once could get. And indeed, every time it has increased you will find there is an increase in minority unemployment among young people. And therefore, I have been in favor of a separate minimum for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to the great progress that has been made with this Government spending, the rate of black unemployment in Detroit, Michigan, is 56 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. President Garter, you have the last word on this question.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. Well, it's obvious that we still have a long way to go in fully incorporating the minority groups into the mainstream of American life. We have made good progress, and there's no doubt in my mind that the commitment to unemployment compensation, the minimum wage, welfare, national health insurance, those kinds of commitments that have typified the Democratic Party since ancient history in this country's political life are a very important element of the future. In all those elements, Governor Reagan has repeatedly spoken out against them, which, to me, shows a very great insensitivity to giving deprived families a better chance in life. This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown, central cities, with the new commitment on an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel-efficient, with a chance for a synthetic fuels program, solar power, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Thank you, gentlemen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for the fourth question, to President Garter from Barbara Walters.\n",
      "\n",
      "INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM\n",
      "\n",
      "MS. WALTERS. Mr. President, the eyes of the country tonight are on the hostages in Iran. I realize this is a sensitive area, but the question of how we respond to acts of terrorism goes beyond this current crisis. Other countries have policies that determine how they will respond. Israel, for example, considers hostages like soldiers and will not negotiate with terrorists.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the future, Mr. President, the country has the right to know, do you have a policy for dealing with terrorism wherever it might happen, and what have we learned from this experience in Iran that might cause us to do things differently if this or something similar happens again?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. Barbara, one of the blights on this world is the threat and the activities of terrorists. At one of the recent economic summit conferences between myself and the other leaders of the We. stern world, we committed ourselves to take strong action against terrorism. Airplane hijacking was one of the elements of that commitment. There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years, in recent months, additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel by the PLO and other terrorist organizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the most serious terrorist threat is if one of those radical nations, who believe in terrorism as a policy, should have atomic weapons. Both I and all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons in countries like Libya or Iraq. We have even alienated some of our closest trade partners, because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Governor Reagan has been asked about that, he makes a very disturbing comment that nonproliferation, or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons, is none of our business. And when he was asked specifically, recently, about Iraq, he said there's nothing we can do about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all, and it's part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Ms. Walters, a followup?\n",
      "\n",
      "MS. WALTERS. Yes. While we are discussing policy, had Iran not taken American hostages, I assume that, in order to preserve our neutrality, we would have stopped the flow of spare parts and vital war materiels once war broke out between Iraq and Iran. Now, we're offering to lift the ban on such goods if they let our people come home. Doesn't this reward terrorism, compromise our neutrality, and possibly antagonize nations now friendly to us in the Middle East?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. We will maintain our position of neutrality in the Iran and Iraq war. We have no plans to sell additional materiel or goods to Iran that might be of a warlike nature. When I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result of the taking of our hostages, I announced then and have consistently maintained since then that if the hostages are released safely, that we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns, which they have bought and paid for-also, that the frozen Iranian assets would be released. That's been a consistent policy, one I intend to carry out.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Would you repeat the question now for Governor Reagan, please, Ms. Walters?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. WALTERS. Yes. Governor, the eyes of the country tonight remain on the hostages in Iran, but the question of how we respond to acts of terrorism goes beyond this current crisis. There are other countries that have policies that determine how they will respond. Israel, for example, considers hostages like soldiers and will not negotiate with terrorists.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the future, the country has the right to know, do you have a policy for dealing with terrorism wherever it might happen, and what have we learned from this experience in Iran that might cause us to do things differently if this, or something similar, should happen again?\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. Well, Barbara, you've asked that question twice. I think you ought to have at least one answer to it. [Laughter]\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been accused lately of having a secret plan with regard to the hostages. Now, this comes from an answer that I've made at least 50 times during this campaign to the press. The question would be, \"Have you any ideas of what you would do if you were there?\" And I said, well, yes. And I think that anyone that's seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, \"What about this, what about that?\" These are just ideas of what I would think of if I were in that position and had access to the information, in which I would know all the options that were open to me. I have never answered the question, however. Second — the one that says, \"Well, tell me, what are some of those ideas?\" First of all, I would be fearful that I might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations, and thus expose it and endanger the hostages. And sometimes, I think some of my ideas might involve quiet diplomacy, where you don't say in advance or say to anyone what it is you're thinking of doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your question is difficult to answer, because, in the situation right now, no one wants to say anything that would inadvertently delay, in any way, the return of those hostages if there is a chance of their coming home soon, or that might cause them harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families and that tragedy is over — and we've endured this humiliation for just lacking 1 week of a year now — then, I think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they come home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about, what arrangements were made? And I would suggest that Congress should hold such an investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, I'm going to continue praying that they'll come home.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Follow-up question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. WALTERS. Well, I would like to say that neither candidate answered specifically the question of a specific policy for dealing with terrorism, but I will ask Governor Reagan a different followup question. You have suggested that there would be no Iranian crisis had you been President, because we would have given firmer support to the Shah. But Iran is a country of 37 million people who were resisting a government they regarded as dictatorial.\n",
      "\n",
      "My question is not whether the Shah's regime was preferable to the Ayatollah's, but whether the United States has the power or the right to try to determine what form of government any country will have, and do we back unpopular regimes whose major merit is that they are friendly to the United States?\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. The degree of unpopularity of a regime when the choice is total authoritarianism — totalitarianism, I should say, in the alternative government, makes one wonder whether you are being helpful to the people. And we've been guilty of that. Because someone didn't meet exactly our standards of human rights, even though they were an ally of ours, instead of trying patiently to persuade them to change their ways, we have, in a number of instances, aided a revolutionary overthrow which results in complete totalitarianism, instead, for those people. And I think that this is a kind of a hypocritical policy when, at the same time, we're maintaining a detente with the one nation in the world where there are no human rights at all — the Soviet Union.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, there was a second phase in the Iranian affair in which we had something to do with that. And that was, we had adequate warning that there was a threat to our Embassy, and we could have done what other Embassies did — either strengthen our security there or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover took place.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Governor, I'm sorry, I must interrupt. President Carter, you have a minute for rebuttal.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. I didn't hear any comment from Governor Reagan about what he would do to stop or to reduce terrorism in the future. What the Western allies did decide to do is to stop all air flights-commercial air flights — to any nation involved in terrorism or the hijacking of airplanes, or the harboring of hijackers. Secondly, we all committed ourselves, as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office, not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives. Third, not to make any sales of materiel or weapons to a nation which is involved in terrorist activities. And, lastly, not to deal with the PLO until and unless the PLO recognizes Israel's right to exist and recognizes U.N. Resolution 242 as a basis for a Middle East peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are a few of the things to which our Nation is committed, and we will continue with these commitments.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Governor Reagan, you have the last word on that question.\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes. I have no quarrel whatsoever with the things that have been done, because I believe it is high time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that there is no room worldwide for terrorism; there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind. And while I have a last word here, I would like to correct a misstatement of fact by the President. I have never made the statement that he suggested about nuclear proliferation, and nuclear proliferation, or the trying to halt it, would be a major part of a foreign policy of mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. SMITH. Thank you, gentlemen. That is the first half of the debate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the rules for the second half, quite simple. They're only complicated when I explain them. [Laughter] In the second half, the panelists with me will have no followup questions. Instead, after the panelists have asked a question the candidates have answered, each of the candidates will have two opportunities to follow up, to question, to rebut, or just to comment on his opponent's statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor Reagan will respond, in this section, to the first question from Marvin Stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "STRATEGIC ARMS LIMITATION\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. STONE. Governor Reagan, arms control: The President said it was the single most important issue, Both of you have expressed the desire to end the nuclear arms race with Russia, but by methods that are vastly different. You suggest that we scrap the SALT II treaty, already negotiated, and intensify the buildup of American power to induce the Soviets to sign a new treaty, one more favorable to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. STONE. President Carter, on the other hand, says he will again try to convince a reluctant Congress to ratify the present treaty on the grounds it's the best we can hope to get.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, both of you cannot be right. Will you tell us why you think you are?\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes. I think I'm right, because I believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy, a strong America, and a strong economy. And then, as we build up our national security, to restore our margin of safety, we at the same time try to restrain the Soviet buildup, which has been going forward at a rapid pace and for quite some time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SALT II treaty was the result of negotiations that Mr. Carter's team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons, and his emissary, I think, came home in 12 hours having heard a very definite yet. But taking that one no from the Soviet Union, we then went back into negotiations on their terms, because Mr. Carter had canceled the B-1 bomber, delayed the MX, delayed the Trident submarine, delayed the cruise missile, shut down the Minuteman missile production line, and whatever other things that might have been done. The Soviet Union sat at the table knowing that we had gone forward with unilateral concessions without any reciprocation from them whatsoever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I have not blocked the SALT II treaty, as Mr. Carter and Mr. Mondale suggest that I have. It has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority. Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with 7 abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States-besides which, it is illegal, because the law of the land, passed by Congress, says we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal. And we're not equal in this treaty for one reason alone: Our B-52 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Governor, I have to interrupt you at that point. The time is up for that. But the same question now to President Carter.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. STONE. Yes, President Carter. Both of you have expressed the desire to end the nuclear arms race with Russia, but through vastly different methods. The Governor suggests we scrap the SALT II treaty, which you signed in Vienna — intensify the buildup of American power to induce the Soviets to sign a new treaty, one more favorable to us. You, on the other hand, say you will again try to convince a reluctant Congress to ratify the present treaty on the grounds it is the best we can hope to get from the Russians.\n",
      "\n",
      "You cannot both be right. Will you tell us why you think you are?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I'd be glad to. Inflation, unemployment, the cities-all very important issues, but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons. Every President who has served in the Oval Office since Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition of controlling nuclear weapons, to negotiate with the Soviet Union — balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan. He has never supported any of those arms control agreements — the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the antiballistic missile treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford — and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a 7-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Senate has not voted yet on the strategic arms limitation treaty. There have been preliminary skirmishings in the committees of the Senate, but the treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote. It's understandable that a Senator in the preliminary debates can make an irresponsible statement, or, maybe, an ill-advised statement. You've got 99 other Senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake. But when a man who hopes to be President says, \"Take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation\" — that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Governor Reagan, you have an opportunity to rebut that.\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes, I'd like to respond very much.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, the Soviet Union — if I have been critical of some of the previous agreements, it's because we've been outnegotiated for quite a long time. And they have managed, in spite of all of our attempts at arms limitation, to go forward with the biggest military buildup in the history of man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, to suggest that because two Republican Presidents tried to pass the SALT treaty — that puts them on its side — I would like to say that President Ford, who was within 90 percent of a treaty that we could be in agreement with when he left office, is emphatically against this SALT treaty. I would like to point out also that Senators like Henry Jackson and Hollings of South Carolina — they are taking the lead in the fight against this particular treaty.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not talking of scrapping; I am talking of taking the treaty back and going back into negotiations. And I would say to the Soviet Union, we will sit and negotiate with you as long as it takes, to have not only legitimate arms limitation but to have a reduction of these nuclear weapons to the point that neither one of us represents a threat to the other. That is hardly throwing away a treaty and being opposed to arms limitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. President Carter?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. Yes. Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements. He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty — and I don't know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form — but he also advocates the possibility-he said it's been a missing element-of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race and insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own Nation as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union.\n",
      "\n",
      "If President Brezhnev said, \"We will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American presidents over a 7-year period of time; we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations; and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations,\" it's obvious that I, as President, and all Americans would reject such a proposition. This would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be very disturbing to American people. It would change the basic tone and commitment that our Nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with all Presidents, Democratic and Republican, and would also be very disturbing to our allies, all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty. In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "This attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone, although it's said with a quiet voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Governor Reagan?\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. I know the President's supposed to be replying to me, but sometimes, I have a hard time in connecting what he's saying with what I have said or what my positions are. I sometimes think he's like the witch doctor that gets mad when a good doctor comes along with a cure that'll work.\n",
      "\n",
      "My point I have made already, Mr. President, with regard to negotiating. It does not call for nuclear superiority on the part of the United States; it calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other. And to suggest that the SALT II treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation, and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous Presidents, is just not true. It was a new negotiation, because, as I say, President Ford was within about 10 percent of having a solution that could be acceptable. And I think our allies would be very happy to go along with a fair and verifiable SALT agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. President Carter, you have the last word on this question.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. I think, to close out this discussion, it would be better to put into perspective what we're talking about.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a discussion with my daughter, Amy, the other day, before I came here, to ask her what the most important issue was. She said she thought nuclear weaponry and the control of nuclear arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a formidable force. Some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion. If you put 50 tons of TNT in each one of railroad cars, you would have a trainload of TNT stretching across this Nation. That's one major war explosion in a warhead. We have thousands, equivalent of megaton, or million tons, of TNT warheads. The control of these weapons is the single major responsibility of a President, and to cast out this commitment of all Presidents, because of some slight technicalities that can be corrected, is a very dangerous approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. We have to go to another question now, from Harry Ellis to President Carter.\n",
      "\n",
      "ENERGY\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. ELLIS. Mr. President, as you have said, Americans, through conservation, are importing much less oil today than we were even a year ago. Yet U.S. dependence on Arab oil as a percentage of total imports is today much higher than it was at the time of the 1973 Arab oil embargo. And for some time to come, the loss of substantial amounts of Arab oil could plunge the U.S. into depression. Now, this means that a bridge must be built out of this dependence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can the United States develop synthetic fuels and other alternative energy sources without damage to the environment, and will this process mean steadily higher fuel bills for American families?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. I don't think there's any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil is going to go up. What I've had as a basic commitment since I've been President is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil: It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy, to stop the waste of energy, and secondly, to produce more American energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've been very successful in both cases. We've now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by onethird. We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same day just a year ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our Nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the conventional kinds of American energy. We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history. We'll produce more coal this year than any year in history. We're exporting more coal this year than any year in history. And we have an opportunity now, with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on the world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source.\n",
      "\n",
      "This exciting future will not only give us more energy security but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we've put into effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Would you repeat the question now for Governor Reagan?\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. ELLIS. Governor Reagan, Americans, through conservation, are importing much less oil today than we were even a year ago. And yet, U.S. reliance on Arab oil as a percentage of total imports is much higher today than it was during the 1973 Arab oil embargo. And the substantial loss of Arab oil could plunge the United States into depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question is whether the development of alternative energy sources, in order to reduce this dependence, can be done without damaging the environment, and will it mean for American families steadily higher fuel bills?\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. I'm not sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs, but I do believe that this Nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as being energy-poor when it is energy-rich. The coal that the President mentioned: Yes, we have it, and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now. The mines are closed down; there are 22,000 miners out of work. Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it. With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act. I think, as technology improves, we'll be able to do even better with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other thing is that we have only leased out and begun to explore 2 percent of our Outer Continental Shelf for oil, where it is believed by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy that there are vast supplies yet to be found. Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were — well, they were public lands subject to multiple-use exploration for minerals and so forth. It is believed that probably 70 percent of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there. This is particularly true of the recent efforts to shut down part of Alaska.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nuclear power: There were 36 powerplants planned in this country — and let me add the word \"safety\"; it must be done with the utmost of safety. But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits and so forth make it take more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have the sources here. We are energy-rich, and coal is one of the great potentials we have.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. President Carter, your comment?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. Yes, sir. To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which we'll realize, to produce 800 million tons of coal — an unequaled record in the history of our country. Governor Reagan says that this is not a good achievement, and he blames restraints on coal production on regulations — regulations that affect the life and the health and safety of miners and also regulations that protect the purity of our air and the quality of our water and our land. We cannot cast aside those regulations. We have a chance in the next 15 years, insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines, and also preserving the same high air and water pollution standards, to triple the amount of coal we produce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor Reagan's approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal or to change substantially the windfall profits tax, to return a major portion of $227 billion back to the oil companies, to do away with the Department of Energy, to shortcircuit our synthetic fuels program, to put a minimal emphasis on solar power, to emphasize strongly nuclear powerplants as a major source of energy in the future. He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Governor Reagan.\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. That is a misstatement, of course, of my position. I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than Government can. The Department of Energy has a multibillion-dollar budget, in excess of $10 billion. It hasn't produced a quart of oil or a lump of coal or anything else in the line of energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "And for Mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws and with the laws that pertain to clean water and clean air, and so forth as Governor of California, I took charge of passing the strictest air pollution laws in the United States — the strictest air quality law that has ever been adopted in the United States. And we created an OSHA, an occupational safety and health agency, for the protection of employees before the Federal Government had one in place. And to this day, not one of its decisions or rulings has ever been challenged.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I think some of those charges are missing the point. I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation. And I would like to see us a little more free, as we once were.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. President Carter, another crack at that?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. Sure. As a matter of fact, the air pollution standard laws that were passed in California were passed over the objections of Governor Reagan, and this is a very well known fact. Also, recently, when someone suggested that the Occupational Safety and Health Act should be abolished, Governor Reagan responded, \"Amen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The offshore drilling rights is a question that Governor Reagan raises often. As a matter of fact, in the proposal for the Alaska lands legislation, 100 percent of all the offshore lands would be open for exploration, and 95 percent of all the Alaska lands where it is suspected or believed that minerals might exist. We have, with our 5-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we're not putting restraints on American exploration; we're encouraging it in every way we can.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Governor Reagan, you have the last word on this question.\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes. If it is a wellknown fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California — not a law, regulations that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations. It would have destroyed the economy of California, and, I must say, we had the support of Congress when pointed out how ridiculous this attempt was by the Environmental Protection Agency. We still have the strictest air control or air pollution laws in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for offshore oiling, only 2 percent now is so leased and is producing oil. The rest, as to whether the lands are going to be opened in the next 5 years or so — we're already 5 years behind in what we should be doing. There is more oil now in the wells that have been drilled than has been taken out in the 121 years that they've been drilled.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Thank you, Governor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next question goes to Governor Reagan from William Hilliard.\n",
      "\n",
      "SOCIAL SECURITY\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. HILLIARD. Governor Reagan, wage earners in this country — especially the young — are supporting a social security system that continues to affect their income drastically. The system is fostering a struggle between the young and the old, and is drifting the country toward a polarization of these two groups. How much longer can the young wage earner expect to bear the ever-increasing burden of the social security system?\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. The social security system was based on a false premise, with regard to how fast the number of workers would increase and how fast the number of retirees would increase. It is actuarially out of balance, and this first became evident about 16 years ago, and some of us were voicing warnings then. Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our Nation's history, the payroll tax increase for social security, which will only put a Band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on social security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check. We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens, leave them thinking that in some way they're endangered and they would have no place to turn. They must continue to get those checks, and I believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis. But it's going to take some study and some work, and not just passing a tax increase to let the roof fall in on the next administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Would you repeat that question for President Carter?\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. HILLIARD. Yes, President Carter. Wage earners in this country, especially the young, are supporting a social security system that continues to affect their income drastically. The system is fostering a struggle between young and old and is drifting the country toward a polarization of these two groups. How much longer can the young wage earner expect to bear the ever-increasing burden of the social security system?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. As long as there's a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable social security system, free of the threat of bankruptcy. Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions he has advocated making social security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it. I noticed also in the Wall Street Journal earlier this week that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making social security more sound by reducing the adjustments in social security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation. These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security and the well-being, and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age.\n",
      "\n",
      "But no matter what it takes in the future to keep social security sound, it must be kept that way. And although there was a serious threat to the social security system and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when I became President, the action of the Democratic Congress, working with me, has been to put social security back on a sound financial basis. That's the way it will stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Governor Reagan.\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. Well, that just isn't true. It has, as I said, delayed the actuarial imbalance falling on us for just a few years with that increase in taxes. And I don't believe we can go on increasing the tax, because the problem for the young people today is that they're paying in far more than they can ever expect to get out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, again this statement that somehow I wanted to destroy it, and I just changed my tune, that I am for voluntary social security, which would mean the ruin of it. Mr. President, the voluntary thing that I suggested many years ago was that a young man, orphaned and raised by an aunt who died, his aunt was ineligible for social security insurance, because she was not his mother. And I suggested that if this is an insurance program, certainly the person who's paying in should be able to name his own beneficiaries. And that's the closest I've ever come to anything voluntary with social security. I, too, am pledged to a social security program that will reassure these senior citizens of ours they're going to continue to get their money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Them are some changes I'd like to make. I would like to make a change that discriminates in the regulations against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her husband's benefits, if he dies first, or what she has paid in; but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself, and she is entitled to more than she presently can get. I'd like to change that.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. President Carter's rebuttal now.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. Fine. These constant suggestions that the basic social security system should be changed does cause concern and consternation among the aged of our country. It's obvious that we should have a commitment to them, that social security benefits should not be taxed, and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which social security payments are made to the retired people. We also need to continue to index the social security payments so that if inflation rises, the social security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of the social security check continue intact.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, the relationship between social security and Medicare has been very important to provide some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits. Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this Nation against Medicare. Now we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease; an emphasis on outpatient care, not inpatient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care for those who are ill; an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it. These are the kind of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people. Governor Reagan, again, typically is against such a proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Governor.\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. There you go again. [Laughter]\n",
      "\n",
      "When I opposed Medicare, there was another piece of legislation meeting the same problem before the Congress. I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed. I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them. I was opposing one piece of legislation as versus another.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is something else about social security — of course, that doesn't come out of the payroll tax; it comes out of the general fund — that something should be done about. I think it's disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in social security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from social security every month while a State institution provides for all of their needs and their care.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. President Carter, you have the last word on this question.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. I think this debate on social security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies as vividly as any other subject tonight the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation. These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this Nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed recently that Governor Reagan frequently quotes Democratic Presidents, in his acceptance address and otherwise. I have never heard a candidate for President, who is a Republican, quote a Republican President, but when they get in office, they try to govern like Republicans. So, its good for the American people to remember there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues-also, between the two parties that we represent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Â MR. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. President, Governor Reagan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Â We now go to another question, a question to President Carter by Barbara Walters.\n",
      "\n",
      "ASSESSMENTS OF OPPONENT\n",
      "\n",
      "MS. WALTERS. Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have addressed some of the major issues tonight, but the biggest issue in the minds of American voters is yourselves, your ability to lead this country. When many voters go into that booth just a week from today, they will be voting their gut instinct about you men.\n",
      "\n",
      "You've already given us your reasons why people should vote for you. Now would you please tell us for this your final question, why they should not vote for your opponent, why his Presidency could be harmful to the Nation and, having examined both your opponent's record and the man himself, tell us his greatest weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question. [Laughter]\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, there's the historical perspective that I just described. This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I've taken in the Oval Office the last 4 years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others. The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations that don't presently have it, particularly the terrorist nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inclination that Governor Reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he's been running for President — I think since 1968 — to inject American military forces in places like North Korea, to put a blockade around Cuba this year, or in some instances, to project American forces into a fishing dispute against the small nation of Ecuador on the west coast of South America — this is typical of his longstanding inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, no President wants war, and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war. But a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way, in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Barbara, would you repeat the question for Governor Reagan?\n",
      "\n",
      "MS. WALTERS. Yes, thank you. Realizing that you may be equally reluctant to speak ill of your opponent, may I ask why people should not vote for your opponent, why his Presidency could be harmful to the Nation? And having examined both your opponent's record and the man himself, could you tell us his greatest weakness?\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. Well, Barbara, I believe that there is a fundamental difference-and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight — that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program. I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers and autonomy and authority that belongs back at the State and local level — it has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people — and that there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves, if they were given a chance, or by the levels of government that were closer to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, as to why I should be and he shouldn't be, when he was a candidate in 1976, President Carter invented a thing he called the misery index. He added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation, and it came, at that time, to 12.5 under President Ford. And he said that no man with that size misery index had a right to seek reelection to the Presidency. Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20 percent, and I think this must suggest something.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when I have quoted a Democrat President, as the President says, I was a Democrat. I said many foolish things back in those days. [Laughter] But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democrat promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept. And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today. And that's why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept. It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. President Carter.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. Yes. I mentioned the radical departure of Governor Reagan from the principles or ideals or historical perspective of his own party. I don't think this can be better illustrated than in the case with guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our Nation. For 40 years, the Republican Party platforms called for guaranteeing women equal rights with a constitutional amendment. Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of women's rights. Governor Reagan and the new Republican Party has departed from this commitment — a very severe blow to the opportunity for women finally to correct discrimination under which they have suffered.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a man and a woman do the same amount of work, a man gets paid a dollar; a woman only gets paid 59 cents. And the equal rights amendment only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for women by the Federal Government or by the State governments. That's all it says — a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic Party and which is a very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagan's radical departure from the longstanding policy of his own party.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Governor Reagan.\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes. Mr. President, once again, I happen to be against the amendment, because I think the amendment will take this problem out of the hands of elected legislators and put it in the hands of unelected judges. I am for equal rights, and while you have been in office for 4 years, and not one single State — and most of them have a majority of Democratic legislators has added to the ratification or voted to ratify the equal rights amendment.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I was Governor, more than 8 years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned, equal pay and so forth. I believe that if in all these years that we've spent trying to get the amendment, that we'd spent as much time correcting these laws, as we did in California — and we were the first to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment. I would have someone ride herd on those regulations, and we'd start eliminating those discriminations in the Federal Government against women.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. President Carter.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. Yes. Howard, I'm a southerner, and I share the basic beliefs of my region about an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system. One of the commitments that I made was to deregulate the major industries of this country. We've been remarkably successful, with the help of the Democratic Congress. We've deregulated the air industry, the rail industry, the trucking industry, financial institutions; now working on the communications industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to that, I believe this element of discrimination is something that the South has seen so vividly as a blight on our region of the country which has now been corrected — not only racial discrimination but discrimination against people that have to work for a living — because we have been trying to pick ourselves up by our bootstraps since the long Depression years and lead a full and useful life in the affairs of this country. We've made remarkable success. It's part of my consciousness and of my commitment to continue this progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, my heritage as a southerner, my experience in the Oval Office, convinces me that what I've just described is a proper course for the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Governor Reagan, yours is the last word.\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. Well, my last word is again to say that we were talking about this very simple amendment and women's rights. And I make it plain again: I am for women's rights. But I would like to call the attention of the people to the fact that so-called simple amendment could be used by mischievous men to destroy discriminations that properly belong, by law, to women, respecting the physical differences between the two sexes, labor laws that protect them against doing things that would be physically harmful to them. Those could all be challenged by men. And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought that was the subject we were supposed to be on. But, if we're talking about how much we think about the working people and so forth, I'm the only fellow that ever ran for this job who was six times president of his own union and still has a lifetime membership in that union.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Gentlemen, each of you now have 3 minutes for a closing statement. President Carter, you're first.\n",
      "\n",
      "CLOSING STATEMENTS\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT. First of all, I'd like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible. I think it's been a very constructive debate, and I hope it's helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan. Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during this last few hours in my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been President now for almost 4 years. I've had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process. I've seen the strength of my Nation, and I've seen the crises that it approached in a tentative way. And I've had to deal with those crises as best I could.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I've studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, I've been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us. I think the results of this debate indicate that that fact is true. I consider myself in the mainstream of my party. I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who've served before me. The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure. We must have a society that's just and fair. And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe that since I've been in office, there've been six or eight areas of combat evolve in other parts of the world. In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country. I've done that with moderation, with care, with thoughtfulness; sometimes consulting experts. But I've learned in this last 3 1/2 years that when an issue is extremely difficult, when the call is very close, the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50-50. And the final judgment about the future of our Nation — war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern — has to be made by the man in the Oval Office. It's a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open government, the job is a very gratifying one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The American people now are facing, next Tuesday, a lonely decision. Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country. And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference. If one vote per precinct had changed in 1960, John Kennedy would never have been President of this Nation. And if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President; Richard Nixon would not.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a partnership involved. And our Nation, to stay strong, to stay at peace, to raise high the banner of human rights, to set an example for the rest of the world, to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in all other nations is my plan for the future. I ask the American people to join me in this partnership.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Governor Reagan.\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes, I would like to add my words of thanks, too, to the ladies of the League of Women Voters for making these debates possible. I'm sorry that we couldn't persuade the bringing in of the third candidate, so that he could have been seen also in these debates. But still, it's good that at least once, all three of us were heard by the people of this country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next Tuesday is election day. Next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls; you'll stand there in the polling place and make a decision. I think when you make that decision, it might be well if you would ask yourself, are you better off than you were 4 years ago? Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was 4 years ago? Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was 4 years ago? Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were 4 years ago? And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to who you'll vote for. If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on for the last 4 years is what you would like to see us follow for the next 4, then I could suggest another choice that you have.\n",
      "\n",
      "This country doesn't have to be in the shape that it is in. We do not have to go on sharing in scarcity, with the country getting worse off, with unemployment growing. We talk about the unemployment lines. If all of the unemployed today were in a single line allowing 2 feet for each one of them, that line would reach from New York City to Los Angeles, California. All of this can be cured, and all of it can be solved.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous State in the Union if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world-I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make. I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this Nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today. I know because we did it there. We cut the cost — the increased cost of government-the increase in half over the 8 years. We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits, and cuts to our people. We, as I've said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that. And I know that we did give back authority and autonomy to the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would like to have a crusade today, and I would like to lead that crusade with your help. And it would be one to take government off the backs of the great people of this country and turn you loose again to do those things that I know you can do so well, because you did them and made this country great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH. Gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, for 60 years the League of Women Voters has been committed to citizen education and effective participation of Americans in governmental and political affairs.

Thank you, Dorothy.\\n\\nA few words as we begin tonight\\'s debate about the format. The position of the candidates-that is, who answers questions first and who gives the last statement--was determined by a toss of a coin between the two candidates.

Then--and this is important-each candidate will have the chance to rebut what the other has said. And the final segment of the debate will be the closing segment, and the candidates will each have 4 minutes for their closing statements. And as I have said, Mr. Mondale will be the last person on the program to speak.\\n\\nAnd now I would like to add a personal note if I may. As Dorothy Ridings pointed out, I have been involved now in four Presidential debates, either as a moderator or as a panelist. In the past, there was no problem in selecting panelists. Tonight, however, there were to have been four panelists participating in this debate.\\n\\nThe candidates were given a list of almost 100 qualified journalists from all the media and could agree on only these three fine journalists. As moderator, and on behalf of my fellow journalists, I very much regret, as does the League of Women Voters, that this situation has occurred.\\n\\nAnd now let us begin the debate with the first question from James Wieghart.\\n\\nMr. Wieghart.\\n\\nThe Nation\\'s Economy\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. Mr. President, in 1980 you promised the American people--in your campaign--a balanced budget by 1983. We\\'ve now had more and bigger deficits in the 4 years you\\'ve been in office. Mr. President, do you have a secret plan to balance the budget sometime in a second term, and if so, would you lay out that plan for us tonight?\\n\\nThe President. I have a plan--not a secret plan. As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981.\\n\\nIt is true that earlier, working with some very prominent economists, I had come up, during the campaign, with an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us--the double-digit inflation, the high tax rates that I think were hurting the economy, the stagflation that we were undergoing. Before even the election day, something that none of those economists had even predicted had happened, that the economy was so worsened that I was openly saying that what we had thought on the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget--no, that was no longer possible.\\n\\nSo, the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy, recovery without inflation, and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product, which has become a drag on the economy.\\n\\nAlready, we have a recovery that has been going on for about 21 months to the point that we can now call it an expansion. Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates.\\n\\nOur tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery. We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was. The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further. In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs--there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military.\\n\\nSo, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending--the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet. And when they meet, that is a balanced budget.\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office has some bad news. The lines aren\\'t about to meet, according to their projections. They project that the budget deficit will continue to climb. In the year 1989 they project a budget deficit of $273 billion.\\n\\nIn view of that, and in view of the economic recovery we are now enjoying, would it make sense to propose a tax increase or take some other fiscal measures to reduce that deficit now, when times are relatively good?\\n\\nThe President. The deficit is the result of excessive government spending. I do not, very frankly, take seriously the Congressional Budget Office projections, because they have been wrong on virtually all of them, including the fact that our recovery wasn\\'t going to take place to begin with. But it has taken place.\\n\\nBut, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent. If the rate of increase in government spending can be held at 5 percent-we\\'re not far from there--by 1989 that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a $30 or $40 billion level. At the same time, if we can have a 4-percent recovery continue through that same period of time, that will mean--without an increase in tax rates--that will mean $400 billion more in government revenues. And so, I think that the lines can meet.\\n\\nActually, in constant dollars, in the domestic side of the budget, there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here.\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. Mr. Mondale, the Carter-Mondale administration didn\\'t come close to balancing the budget in its 4 years in office either, despite the fact that President Carter did promise a balanced budget during his term.\\n\\nYou have proposed a plan combining tax increases and budgetary cuts and other changes in the administration of the Government that would reduce the projected budget deficit by two-thirds, to approximately $87 billion in 1989. That still is an enormous deficit that will be running for these 4 years. What other steps do you think should be taken to reduce this deficit and position the country for economic growth?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation. And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits.\\n\\nI respect the President; I respect the Presidency, and I think he knows that. But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars. As a matter of fact, over 4 years, they\\'ve missed the mark by nearly $600 billion. We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983. It was $200 billion deficit instead. And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we\\'ll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery.\\n\\nVirtually every economic analysis that I\\'ve heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit. In other words, it doesn\\'t converge as the President suggests. It gets larger even with growth.\\n\\nWhat that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade. This is the worst trade year in American history by far. Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation. Real interest rates--the real cost of interest-will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we\\'re moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession. I get it down to a level below 2 percent of gross national product with a policy that\\'s fair. I\\'ve stood up and told the American people that I think it\\'s a real problem, that it can destroy long-term economic growth, and I\\'ve told you what I think should be done.\\n\\nI think this is a test of leadership, and I think the American people know the difference.\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. Mr. Mondale, one other way to attack the deficit is further reductions in spending. The President has submitted a number of proposals to Congress to do just that, and in many instances the House, controlled by the Democrats, has opposed them. Isn\\'t it one aspect of leadership for prominent Democrats such as yourself to encourage responsible reductions in spending, and thereby reduce the deficit?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Absolutely, and I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over 4 years, but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things-- [applause] --that people need. These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and I\\'m not going to do it that way.\\n\\nThe rate of defense spending increase can be slowed. Certainly we can find a coffeepot that costs something less than $7,000. And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life. And that\\'s why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the President\\'s recommendations.\\n\\nMs. Walters. I would like to ask the audience please to refrain from applauding either side; it just takes away from the time for your candidates.\\n\\nAnd now it is time for the rebuttal. Mr. President, 1 minute for rebuttal.\\n\\nThe President. Yes. I don\\'t believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes. And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation\\'s history took place 1977. And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion. So, there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget. Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, you\\'re taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down government\\'s share of what it is taking.\\n\\nWith regard to Social Security, I hope there\\'ll be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this: A President should never say \"never.\" But I\\'m going to violate that rule and say \"never.\" I will never stand for a reduction of the Social Security benefits to the people that are now getting them.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Mr. Mondale?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Well, that\\'s exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits. And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent-reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying--with widows trying to get them through college. Everybody remembers that; people know what happened.\\n\\nThere\\'s a difference. I have fought for Social Security and Medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life, and I will do it as President of the United States.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Thank you very much. We\\'ll now begin with segment number two with my colleague, Diane Sawyer.\\n\\nMs. Sawyer?\\n\\nLeadership Qualities\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. Mr. President, Mr. Mondale, the public opinion polls do suggest that the American people are most concerned about the personal leadership characteristics of the two candidates, and each of you has questioned the other\\'s leadership ability. Mr. President, you have said that Mr. Mondale\\'s leadership would take the country down the path of defeatism and despair, and Vice President Bush has called him whining and hoping for bad news. And, Mr. Mondale, you have said that President Reagan offers showmanship, not leadership, that he has not mastered what he must know to command his government.\\n\\nI\\'d like to ask each of you to substantiate your claims--Mr. Mondale first. Give us specifics to support your claim that President Reagan is a showman, not a leader; has not mastered what he must know to be President after 4 years, and then, second, tell us what personal leadership characteristics you have that he does not.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what I\\'m saying. There is no question that we face this massive deficit, and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down, the chances for long-term, healthy growth are nil. And it\\'s also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children.\\n\\nThe President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason. No one else believes that\\'s the case. I do, and I\\'m standing up to the issue with an answer that\\'s fair. I think that\\'s what leadership is all about. There\\'s a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when there\\'s a real problem, a President must confront it.\\n\\nWhat I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon. Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions. The first time--and I did not criticize the President, because these things can happen--once, and sometimes twice-the second time the barracks in Lebanon were assaulted, as we all remember. There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves.\\n\\nNow, I believe that a President must command that White House and those who work for him. It\\'s the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done. I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what\\'s needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead. And that\\'s why in this campaign I\\'m telling you exactly what I want to do. I am answering your questions. I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision.\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. You have said, Mr. Mondale, that the polls have given you lower ratings on leadership than President Reagan because your message has failed to get through. Given that you have been in public office for so many years, what accounts for the failure of your message to get through?\\n\\nMr, Mondale. Well, I think we\\'re getting better all the time. And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other. And I think, as a part of that process, what I am trying to say will come across, and that is that we must lead, we must command, we must direct, and a President must see it like it is. He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. Mr. President, the issue is leadership in personal terms. First, do you think, as Vice President Bush said, that Mr. Mondale\\'s campaign is one of whining and hoping for bad news? And second, what leadership characteristics do you possess that Mr. Mondale does not?\\n\\nThe President. Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since you\\'ve asked it. And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security-before I get to the answer to your question--the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916.\\n\\nNow, leadership. First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in. In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society--that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society.\\n\\nNow, having that, I think also that in leadership--well, I believe that you find people, positions such as I\\'m in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government. I don\\'t believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who\\'s going to play tennis on the White House court. And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job. You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.\\n\\nBut I also believe something else about that. I believe that--and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office--that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue. I don\\'t want to hear them. I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people--is it morally right? And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue.\\n\\nNow, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren\\'t to be abhorred--that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. As a followup, let me draw in another specific, if I could--a specific that the Democrats have claimed about your campaign--that it is essentially based on imagery. And one specific that they allege is that, for instance, recently you showed up at the opening ceremony of a Buffalo old-age housing project, when in fact, your policy was to cut Federal housing subsidies for the elderly. Yet you were there to have your picture taken with them.\\n\\nThe President. Our policy was not to cut subsidies. We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure. And this is what we\\'ve been trying to do, is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships.\\n\\nWe are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and we\\'re going to continue along that line. We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need. We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need. The safety net is there, and we\\'re taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Mr. Mondale, an opportunity for you to rebut.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Well, I guess I\\'m reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover. He said, \"It\\'s not what he doesn\\'t know that bothers me; it\\'s what he knows for sure that just ain\\'t so.\" [Laughter] The fact of it is: The President\\'s budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent. It\\'s not an opinion; it\\'s a fact. And when the President was asked the other day, \"What do you want to cut in the budget?\", he said, \"Cut those things I asked for but didn\\'t get.\" That\\'s Social Security and Medicare.\\n\\nThe second fact is that the housing unit for senior citizens that the President dedicated in Buffalo was only made possible through a Federal assistance program for senior citizens that the President\\'s budget sought to terminate. So, if he\\'d had his way, there wouldn\\'t have been any housing project there at all. This administration has taken a meat cleaver out, in terms of Federal-assisted housing, and the record is there. We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Mr. President?\\n\\nThe President. Well, let me just respond with regard to Social Security. When we took office, we discovered that the program that the Carter-Mondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of Social Security for the next 50 years wouldn\\'t solve them for 5. Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.\\n\\nAny proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees, who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce. And so, we made a proposal. And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign. And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke. Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks. And then I asked for a bipartisan commission, which I\\'d asked for from the beginning, to sit down and work out a solution.\\n\\nAnd so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Mr. President, we begin segment number three with Fred Barnes.\\n\\nReligion\\n\\nMr. Barnes. Mr. President, would you describe your religious beliefs, noting particularly whether you consider yourself a born-again Christian, and explain how these beliefs affect your Presidential decisions?\\n\\nThe President. Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since I was a small boy. In our particular church, we did not use that term, \"born again,\" so I don\\'t know whether I would fit that--that particular term. But I have--thanks to my mother, God rest her soul--the firmest possible belief and faith in God. And I don\\'t believe--I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not--I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others. And I do resort to prayer.\\n\\nAt the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign--or religion a part of that campaign. As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale\\'s running mate said I wasn\\'t a good Christian.\\n\\nSo, it does play a part in my life. I have no hesitancy in saying so. And, as I say, I don\\'t believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered.\\n\\nMr. Barnes. Given those beliefs, Mr. President, why don\\'t you attend services regularly, either by going to church or by inviting a minister to the White House, as President Nixon used to do, or someone to Camp David, as President Carter used to do?\\n\\nThe President. The answer to your question is very simple about why I don\\'t go to church. I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington. And now, in the position I hold and in the world in which we live, where Embassies do get blown up in Beirut--we\\'re supposed to talk about that on the debate the 21st, I understand--but I pose a threat to several hundred people if I go to church.\\n\\nI know the threats that are made against me. We all know the possibility of terrorism. We have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the White House. And, therefore, I don\\'t feel--and my minister knows this and supports me in this position--I don\\'t feel that I have a right to go to church, knowing that my being there could cause something of the kind that we have seen in other places, in Beirut, for example. And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands. [Applause]\\n\\nMs. Walters. May I ask you, please-- [applause] --may I ask the audience please to refrain from applause.\\n\\nFred, your second question.\\n\\nMr. Barnes. Mr. Mondale, would you describe your religious beliefs and mention whether you consider yourself a born-again Christian, and explain how those beliefs would affect your decisions as President?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. First of all, I accept President Reagan\\'s affirmation of faith. I\\'m sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact.\\n\\nI am a son of a Methodist minister. My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister. And I don\\'t know if I\\'ve been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family. And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency. Whether that helps or not, I don\\'t know.\\n\\nI have a deep religious faith. Our family does. It is fundamental. It\\'s probably the reason that I\\'m in politics. I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead. And I think we\\'re all together on that.\\n\\nWhat bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use one\\'s own personal interpretation of faith politically, to question others\\' faith, and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others. All history tells us that that\\'s a mistake.\\n\\nWhen the Republican platform says that from here on out, we\\'re going to have a religious test for judges before they\\'re selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think that\\'s an abuse of faith in our country.\\n\\nThis nation is the most religious nation on Earth--more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth-and it\\'s because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith. That\\'s why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians. And I think if we want to continue--as I do--to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Thank you. Mr. Barnes, next question. We have time for rebuttal now.\\n\\nMr. Barnes. I think I have a followup.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Yes, I asked you if you did. I\\'m sorry.--\\n\\nMr. Barnes. Yes, I do.\\n\\nMs. Walters. --I thought you waived it.\\n\\nMr. Barnes. Yes, Mr. Mondale, you\\'ve complained, just now, about Jerry Falwell, and you\\'ve complained other times about other fundamentalists in politics. Correct me if I\\'m wrong, but I don\\'t recall your ever complaining about ministers who are involved in the civil rights movement or in the anti-Vietnam war demonstrations or about black preachers who\\'ve been so involved in American politics. Is it only conservative ministers that you object to?\\n\\nMr. Mondale, No. What I object to-- [applause] --what I object to--what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others.\\n\\nA minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire. The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people, hopefully, I accept and rejoice in. It\\'s when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political--or private religious faith and the use of the state is where--for the most personal decisions in American life--that\\'s where I draw the line.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Thank you. Now, Mr. President, rebuttal.\\n\\nThe President. Yes, it\\'s very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale. I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there. The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion. And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion. A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can\\'t do it because it\\'s school property. These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that.\\n\\nWith regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that. I have appointed one member to the Supreme Court: Sandra Day O\\'Connor. I\\'ll stand on my record on that. And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I\\'ll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Mr. Mondale, your rebuttal, please.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. The platform to which the President refers, in fact, calls for a religious test in the selection of judges. And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges. And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life.\\n\\nLet\\'s take the example that the President cites. I believe in prayer. My family prays. We\\'ve never had any difficulty finding time to pray. But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves? Who would write the prayer? What would it say? How would it be resolved when those disputes occur?\\n\\nIt seems to me that a moment\\'s reflection tells you why the United States Senate turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it. We don\\'t want that.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Thank you, Mr. Mondale. Our time is up for this round.\\n\\nWe go into the second round of our questioning, begin again with Jim Wieghart.\\n\\nJim?\\n\\nPolitical Issues\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. After that discussion, this may be like going from the sublime to the ridiculous, but here goes. I have a political question for you, Mr. Mondale. [Laughter]\\n\\nPolls indicate a massive change in the electorate, away from the coalition that has long made the Democratic Party a majority. Blue-collar workers, young professionals, their children, and much of the middle class now regard themselves as Independents or Republican instead of Democrats, and the gap--the edge the Democrats had in party registration seems to be narrowing.\\n\\nI\\'d like to ask you, Mr. Mondale, what is causing this? Is the Democratic Party out of sync with the majority of Americans? And will it soon be replaced as the majority party by the Republicans? What do you think needs to be done about it, as a Democrat?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. My answer is that this campaign isn\\'t over yet. And when people vote, I think you\\'re going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that I\\'m talking about.\\n\\nThe American people want arms control. They don\\'t want this arms race. And they don\\'t want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens. And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world.\\n\\nThe American people see this debt, and they know it\\'s got to come down. And if it won\\'t come down, the economy\\'s going to slow down, maybe go into a recession. They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history. And they know this debt must come down as well, because it\\'s unfair to our children.\\n\\nThe American people want this environment protected. They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that people\\'s lives and health are being risked, because we\\'ve had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment.\\n\\nThe American people want their children educated. They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that\\'s widening between the United States and Europe and Japan.\\n\\nThe American people want to keep opening doors. They want those civil rights laws enforced. They want the equal rights amendment ratified. They want equal pay for comparable effort for women. And they want it because they\\'ve understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we\\'re all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics.\\n\\nI think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause.\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. Mr. Mondale, isn\\'t it possible that the American people have heard your message--and they are listening--but they are rejecting it?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit. The President says it\\'ll disappear automatically. I\\'ve said it\\'s going to take some work. I think the American people will draw their own conclusions.\\n\\nSecondly, I\\'ve said that I will not support the cuts in Social Security and Medicare and the rest that the President has proposed. The President answers that it didn\\'t happen or, if it did, it was resolved later in a commission. As the record develops, I think it\\'s going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. Mr. President, you and your party are benefiting from what appears to be an erosion of the old Democratic coalition, but you have not laid out a specific agenda to take this shift beyond November 6th. What is your program for America for the next decade, with some specificity?\\n\\nThe President. Well, again, I\\'m running on the record. I think sometimes Mr. Mondale\\'s running away from his. But I\\'m running on the record of what we have asked for. We\\'ll continue to try to get things that we didn\\'t get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6.1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government. And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago--I know, because I was a Democrat at that time. And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people.\\n\\nI promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation. We have, to onethird of what it was. I promised that we would reduce taxes. We did, 25 percent across the board. That barely held even with--if it did that much--with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977. But at least it took that burden away from them.\\n\\nI said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did--6 million in the last 20 or 21 months. I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons. We have done that.\\n\\nAll of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done. And I think this is something the American people see.\\n\\nI think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education--on excellence in education. And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems. We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth. All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.\\n\\nSo, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn\\'t taking us where we want to go.\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. Mr. President, much of what you said affects the quality of life of many Americans--their income, the way they live, and so forth--but there\\'s an aspect to quality of life that lies beyond the private sector which has to do with our neighborhoods, our cities, our streets, our parks, our environment. In those areas, I have difficulty seeing what your program is and what you feel the Federal responsibility is in these areas of the quality of life in the public sector that affects everybody, and even enormous wealth by one individual can\\'t create the kind of environment that he might like.\\n\\nThe President. There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well, and you\\'ve named some of them. Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down--or since we\\'ve kept records--2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we\\'ve had. I think that we\\'ve had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.\\n\\nThe environment? Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment. When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5-year program--but it\\'s just about finished already--a billion dollars. And now we\\'re going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks. We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges. I think that we\\'re out in front of most--and I see that the red light is blinking, so I can\\'t continue. But I\\'ve got more.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Well, you\\'ll have a chance when your rebuttal time comes up, perhaps,\\n\\nMr. President. Mr. Mondale, now it\\'s your turn for rebuttal.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. The President says that when the Democratic Party made its turn, he left it. The year that he decided we had lost our way was the year that John F. Kennedy was running against Richard Nixon. I was chairman of \"Minnesotans for Kennedy;\" President Reagan was chairman of a thing called \"Democrats for Nixon.\" Now, maybe we made a wrong turn with Kennedy, but I\\'ll be proud of supporting him all of my life. And I\\'m very happy that John Kennedy was elected, because John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government.\\n\\nThe President just said that his government is shrinking. It\\'s not. It\\'s now the largest peacetime government ever in terms of the take from the total economy. And instead of retreating.--instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life. That\\'s where government should not be.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Mr. President?\\n\\nThe President. Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States. And so, my change had come earlier than that. I hadn\\'t gotten around to reregistering as yet. I found that was rather difficult to do. But I finally did it.\\n\\nThere are some other things that have been said here--back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up. Mr. Mondale referred to the farmers\\' worst year. The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done. The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 21 1/2-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier. All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers. As a matter of fact, there has been less than one-quarter of i percent of foreclosures of the 270,000 loans from government that the farmers have.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Thank you, Mr. President. We\\'ll now turn to Diane Sawyer for her round of questions.\\n\\nDiane?\\n\\nAbortion\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. I\\'d like to turn to an area that I think few people enjoy discussing, but that we probably should tonight because the positions of the two candidates are so clearly different and lead to very different policy consequences--and that is abortion and right to life. I\\'m exploring for your personal views of abortion and specifically how you would want them applied as public policy.\\n\\nFirst, Mr. President. Do you consider abortion murder or a sin? And second, how hard would you work--what kind of priority would you give in your second term legislation to make abortion illegal? And specifically, would you make certain, as your party platform urges, that Federal justices that you appoint be pro-life?\\n\\nThe President. I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life. Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life. But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is-there\\'s been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government. With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it\\'s a problem of the Constitution.\\n\\nI believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us. And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying--I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious--there were clerics there-everyone talking about this matter of pro-life. And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive. We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around.\\n\\nAlso, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life. In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor--signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder. Now, isn\\'t it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that\\'s murder? And it used the term \"death of the unborn child.\"\\n\\nSo, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine--and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being.\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. A two-part followup. Do I take it from what you\\'ve said about the platform, then, that you don\\'t regard the language and don\\'t regard in your own appointments, abortion position a test of any kind for justices--that it should be? And also, if abortion is made illegal, how would you want it enforced? Who would be the policing units that would investigate? And would you want the women who have abortions to be prosecuted?\\n\\nThe President. The laws regarding that always were State laws. It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy. Our laws against murder are State laws. So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this.\\n\\nAs I say, I feel that we have a problem here to resolve. And no one has approached it from that matter. It does not happen that the church that I belong to had that as part of its dogma. I know that some churches do.\\n\\nNow, it is a sin if you\\'re taking a human life. At the same time, in our Judeo-Christian tradition, we recognize the right of taking a human life in self-defense. And therefore, I\\'ve always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own.\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. Mr. Mondale, to turn to you, do you consider abortion a murder or a sin? And bridging from what President Reagan said, he has written that if society doesn\\'t know whether life does--human life, in fact, does begin at conception, as long as there is a doubt, that the unborn child should at least be given the benefit of the doubt and that there should be protection for that unborn child.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated. I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people.\\n\\nThe constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest. Is it really the view of the American people, however you feel on the question of abortion, that government ought to be reaching into your living rooms and making choices like this? I think it cannot work, won\\'t work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law. Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them. The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do.\\n\\nI think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different. Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step. But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do.\\n\\nNow, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion. Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her. That\\'s always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime. But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped? Do we really want those decisions made by judges who\\'ve been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty? I don\\'t think so, and I think it\\'s going in exactly the wrong direction.\\n\\nIn America, on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives. We haven\\'t felt so insecure that we\\'ve reached for the club of state to have our point of view. It\\'s been a good instinct. And we\\'re the most religious people on Earth.\\n\\nOne final point: President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal pro-abortion bill of any State in the Union.\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. But if I can get you back for a moment on my point, which was the question of when human life begins--a two-part followup. First of all, at what point do you believe that human life begins in the growth of a fetus? And second of all, you said that government shouldn\\'t be involved in the decisions. Yet there are those who would say that government is involved, and the consequence of the involvement was 1.5 million abortions in 1980. And how do you feel about that?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. The basic decision of the Supreme Court is that each person has to make this judgment in her own life, and that\\'s the way it\\'s been done. And it\\'s a personal and private, moral judgment. I don\\'t know the answer to when life begins. And it\\'s not that simple, either. You\\'ve got another life involved. And if it\\'s rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that? If it\\'s incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that? Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment? It won\\'t work. [Applause]\\n\\nMs. Walters. I\\'m sorry to do this, but I really must talk to the audience.\\n\\nYou\\'re all invited guests. I know I\\'m wasting time in talking to you, but it really is very unfair of you to applaud--sometimes louder, less loud--and I ask you, as people who were invited here, and polite people, to refrain.\\n\\nWe have our time now for rebuttal. Mr. President.\\n\\nThe President. Yes. Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isn\\'t that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that?\\n\\nNow, I\\'m not capable, and I don\\'t think you are, any of us, to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life. I am simply saying that I believe that that\\'s where the effort should be directed--to make that determination.\\n\\nI don\\'t think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition. That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that we\\'re talking about a life. But in this great society of ours, wouldn\\'t it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption? There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can\\'t have them any other way.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Mr. Mondale.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. I agree with that, and that\\'s why I was a principal sponsor of a liberal adoption law, so that more of these children could come to term, so that the young mothers were educated, so we found an option, an alternative. I\\'m all for that. But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued. And I don\\'t agree with it.\\n\\nSince I\\'ve got about 20 seconds, let me just say one thing. The question of agriculture came up a minute ago. Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it. And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent. It\\'s been a big failure. I opposed the grain embargo in my administration. I\\'m opposed to these policies as well.\\n\\nMs. Walters. I\\'m sitting here like the great schoolteacher, letting you both get away with things--because one did it, the other one did it. May I ask in the future that the rebuttal stick to what the rebuttal is. And also, foreign policy will be the next debate. Stop dragging it in by its ear into this one. [Laughter]\\n\\nNow, having admonished you, I would like to say to the panel, you are allowed one question and one followup. Would you try, as best you could, not to ask two and three--I know it\\'s something we all want to do--two and three questions as part one and two and three as part two.\\n\\nHaving said that, Fred, it\\'s yours.\\n\\nFederal Taxation\\n\\nMr. Barnes. Thank you. Mr. Mondale, let me ask you about middle-class Americans and the taxes they pay. Now, I\\'m talking not about the rich or the poor--I know your views on their taxes--but about families earning 25,000 to 45,000 a year. Do you think that those families are overtaxed or undertaxed by the Federal Government?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didn\\'t get any relief the first time around.\\n\\nUnder the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up. That\\'s why my proposal protects everybody from $25,000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70,000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a fiat tax.\\n\\nWhat does this mean in real life? Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people. He\\'s one of the wealthiest Americans, and he\\'s our Vice President. In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes. In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes. That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work.\\n\\nI believe we need some fairness. And that\\'s why I\\'ve proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who\\'ve already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.\\n\\nMr. Barnes. It sounds as if you are saying you think this group of taxpayers making 25,000 to 45,000 a year is already overtaxed, yet your tax proposal would increase their taxes. I think your aides have said those earning about 25,000 to 35,000, their tax rate would go up--their tax bill would go up a hundred dollars, and from 35,000 to 45,000, more than that, several hundred dollars. Wouldn\\'t that stifle their incentive to work and invest and so on, and also hurt the recovery?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. The first thing is, everybody 25,000 and under would have no tax increase.\\n\\nMr. Reagan, after the election, is going to have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes. And his Secretary of the Treasury said he\\'s studying a sales tax or a value-added tax. They\\'re the same thing. They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched.\\n\\nUp until about $70,000, as you go up the ladder, my proposals will be far more beneficial. As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, I\\'d like to see the total repeal of indexing. I don\\'t think we can do that for a few years. But at some point, we want to do that as well.\\n\\nMr. Barnes. Mr. President, let me try this on you. Do you think middle-income Americans are overtaxed or undertaxed?\\n\\nThe President. You know, I wasn\\'t going to say this at all, but I can\\'t help it. There you go again. [Laughter] I don\\'t have a plan to tax--or increase taxes. I\\'m not going to increase taxes. I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.\\n\\nNow, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; it\\'s that government is overfed. And I think that most of our people--this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up. And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from 50,000 down. From 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut.\\n\\nNow, the Social Security tax of \\'77--this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest. It had two features. It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time--there are two more yet to come between now and 1989. At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money--virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there--that was subject to that tax. Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security. And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20--they\\'re paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money.\\n\\nNow, I don\\'t think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn\\'t work out that way. The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I\\'ve said, and that has not been changed. But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage, yes, you could say, well, that person got 10 times as much as this other person. Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also. But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.\\n\\nMr. Barnes. I thought I caught, Mr. President, a glimmer of a stronger statement there in your answer than you\\'ve made before. I think the operative position you had before was that you would only raise taxes in a second term as a last resort, and I thought you said flatly that \"I\\'m not going to raise taxes.\" Is that what you meant to say, that you will not--that you will flatly not raise taxes in your second term as President\\'?\\n\\nThe President. Yes, I had used--\"last resort\" would always be with me. If you got the Government down to the lowest level, that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people, and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth, and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines, then I had said once that, yes, you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted.\\n\\nI don\\'t foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I\\'m not going to go for a tax.\\n\\nWith regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there--had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust. All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Mr. Mondale, here we go again. It\\'s time for rebuttal.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Well, first of all, I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the house deal. I\\'m just talking about the 12.8 percent that he paid, and that\\'s what\\'s happening all over this country with wealthy Americans. They\\'ve got so many loopholes they don\\'t have to pay much in taxes.\\n\\nNow, Mr. President, you said, \"There you go again,\" right?\\n\\nThe President. Yes.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. You remember the last time you said that?\\n\\nThe President. Mm-hmm.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. You said it when President Carter said that you were going to cut Medicare, and you said, \"Oh, no, there you go again, Mr. President.\" And what did you do right after the election? You went out and tried to cut $20 billion out of Medicare. And so, when you say, \"There you go again\"--people remember this, you know. [Laughter] And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States, and what are you going to do? You\\'ve got a $260 billion deficit. You can\\'t wish it away. You won\\'t slow defense spending; you refuse to do that--\\n\\nMs. Walters. Mr. Mondale, I\\'m afraid your time is up.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Sorry.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Mr. President?\\n\\nThe President. Yes. With regard to Medicare, no, but it\\'s time for us to say that Medicare is in pretty much the same condition that Social Security was, and something is going to have to be done in the next several years to make it fiscally sound. And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem. And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.\\n\\nMs. Walters. All right. Fine.\\n\\nThe President. I gave you back some of that time. [Laughter]\\n\\nMs. Walters. We can\\'t keep going back for other rebuttals; there\\'ll be time later.\\n\\nWe now go to our final round. The way things stand now, we have time for only two sets of questions, and by lot, it will be Jim and Diane. And we\\'ll start with Jim Wieghart.\\n\\nSocial Welfare Programs\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. Mr. President, the economic recovery is real, but uneven. The Census Bureau, just a month ago, reported that there are more people living under poverty now, a million more people living under it, than when you took office.\\n\\nThere have been a number of studies, including studies by the Urban Institute and other nonpolitical organizations, that say that the impact of the tax and budget cuts and your economic policies have impacted severely on certain classes of Americans-working mothers, head of households, minority groups, elderly poor. In fact, they\\'re saying the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer under your policies.\\n\\nWhat relief can you offer to the working poor, to the minorities, and to the women head of households who have borne the brunt of these economic programs? What can you offer them in the future, in your next term?\\n\\nThe President. Well, some of those facts and figures just don\\'t stand up. Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here. It has begun to decline, but it is still going up.\\n\\nOn the other hand, women heads of household--single women heads of household have--for the first time there\\'s been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them. We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings. It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs.\\n\\nWe are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980. We\\'re spending a third more on all of the-well, all of the programs of human service. We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before--2,300,000 more are receiving them--even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them. We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits. We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy.\\n\\nSome time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind. Half--one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid. But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans. We didn\\'t think that was right. And so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low.\\n\\nSo, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have. 7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings--7.7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million.\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. Mr. President, in a visit to Texas--in Brownsville, I believe it was, in the Rio Grande Valley--you did observe that the economic recovery was uneven.\\n\\nThe President. Yes.\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. In that particular area of Texas, unemployment was over 14 percent, whereas statewide, it was the lowest in the country, I believe--5.6 percent. And you made the comment, however, that man does not live by bread alone. What did you mean by that comment? And if I interpret it correctly, it would be a comment more addressed to the affluent who obviously can look beyond just the bread they need to sustain them, with their wherewithal.\\n\\nThe President. That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything. I remember distinctly, I was segueing into another subject. I was talking about the things that have been accomplished, and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism, the new spirit that we\\'re finding all over America. And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people. So, that was the only place that that was used.\\n\\nI did avoid, I\\'m afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes. There is no way that the recovery is even across the country, just as in the depths of the recession, there were some parts of the country that were worse off, but some that didn\\'t even feel the pain of the recession.\\n\\nWe\\'re not going to rest and not going to be happy until every person in this country who wants a job can have one, until the recovery is complete across the country.\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. Mr. Mondale, as you can gather from the question to the President, the celebrated War on Poverty obviously didn\\'t end the problem of poverty, although it may have dented it. The poor and the homeless and the disadvantaged are still with us. What should the Federal Government\\'s role be to turn back the growth in the number of people living below the poverty level, which is now 35 million in the United States, and to help deal with the structural unemployment problems that the President was referring to in an uneven recovery?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Number one, we\\'ve got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed.\\n\\nNumber two, we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities--through the Urban Development Action Grant Program. I don\\'t mind those enterprise zones; let\\'s try them, but not as a substitute for the others. Certainly education and training is crucial. If these young Americans don\\'t have the skills that make them attractive to employees, they\\'re not going to get jobs.\\n\\nThe next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which they\\'re found. The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth.\\n\\nThere is no question that the poor are worse off. I think the President genuinely believes that they\\'re better off. But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago. How you can cut school lunches, how you can cut student assistance, how you can cut housing, how you can cut disability benefits, how you can do all of these things and then the people receiving them for example, the disabled, who have no alternative--how they\\'re going to do better, I don\\'t know. Now, we need a tight budget, but there\\'s no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they\\'re hurting.\\n\\nOne final point if I might. There\\'s another part of the lopsided economy that we\\'re in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports. We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year. That\\'s another reason to get the deficit down.\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. Mr. Mondale, is it possible that the vast majority of Americans who appear to be prosperous have lost interest in the kinds of programs you\\'re discussing to help those less privileged than they are?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent. I think they stand for civil rights. I know they\\'re all for education in science and training, which I strongly support. They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest. I think the business community wants to get involved. I think they\\'re asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved. I think that\\'s part of it. I think also that the American people want a balanced program that gives us long-term growth so that they\\'re not having to take money that\\'s desperate to themselves and their families and give it to someone else. I\\'m opposed to that, too.\\n\\nMs. Walters. And now it is time for our rebuttal for this period. Mr. President?\\n\\nThe President. Yes. The connection that\\'s been made again between the deficit and the interest rates--there is no connection between them. There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited--that the interest rates came down from 21 1/2, down toward the 12 or 13 figure. And while they were coming down, the deficits had started their great increase. They were going up. Now, if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down.\\n\\nThe interest rates are based on inflation. And right now I have to tell you I don\\'t think there is any excuse for the interest rates being as high as they are because we have brought inflation down so low. I think it can only be that they\\'re anticipating or hope--expecting, not hoping, that maybe we don\\'t have a control of inflation and it\\'s going to go back up again. Well, it isn\\'t going to go back up. We\\'re going to see that it doesn\\'t.\\n\\nAnd I haven\\'t got time to answer with regard to the disabled.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nMr. Mondale.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits don\\'t have anything to do with interest rates. I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why--energy prices and so on. There\\'s no way of glossing around that. But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981, what\\'s called the real interest rates--the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled--and that\\'s still the case today. And the result is interest costs that have never been seen before in terms of real charges, and it\\'s attributable to the deficit.\\n\\nEverybody--every economist, every businessman-believes that. Your own Council of Economic Advisers--Mr. Feldstein in his report told you that. Every chairman of the Finance and Ways and Means Committee, Republican leaders in the Senate and the House are telling you that. That deficit is ruining the long-term hopes for this economy. It\\'s causing high interest rates. It\\'s ruining us in trade. It\\'s given us the highest small business failure in 50 years. The economy is starting downhill with housing failure.-\\n\\nMs. Walters. Thank you, Mr. Mondale.\\n\\nYou\\'re both very obedient. I have to give you credit for that.\\n\\nWe now start our final round of questions. We do want to have time for your rebuttal.\\n\\nWe start with Diane--Diane Sawyer.\\n\\nPresidential Campaign\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. Since we are reaching the end of the question period, and since in every Presidential campaign, the candidates tend to complain that the opposition candidate is not held accountable for what he or she says, let me give you the chance to do that.\\n\\nMr. Mondale, beginning with you. What do you think the most outrageous thing is your opponent said in this debate tonight? [Laughter]\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Do you want to give me some suggestions? [Laughter] I\\'m going to use my time a little differently. I\\'m going to give the President some credit. I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit, morale, good feeling in this country, and he\\'s entitled to credit for that. What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with America\\'s problems.\\n\\nI think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didn\\'t like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit. But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training.\\n\\nI like President Reagan. And this is not personal--there are deep differences about our future, and that\\'s the basis of my campaign.\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. Follow up in a similar vein, then. What remaining question would you most like to see your opponent forced to answer?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Without any doubt, I have stood up and told the American people that that $263 billion deficit must come down. And I\\'ve done what no candidate for President has ever done, I told you before the election what I\\'d do.\\n\\nMr. Reagan, as you saw tonight--President Reagan takes the position it will disappear by magic. It was once called voodoo economics. I wish the President would say: Yes, the CBO is right. Yes, we have a $263 billion deficit. This is how I\\'m going to get it done. Don\\'t talk about growth, because even though we need growth, that\\'s not helping. It\\'s going to go in the other direction, as they\\'ve estimated.\\n\\nAnd give us a plan. What will you cut? Whose taxes will you raise? Will you finally touch that defense budget? Are you going to go after Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and the handicapped again as you did last time? If you\\'d just tell us what you\\'re going to do, then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan. And that\\'s the way it should be. The American people would be in charge.\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. Mr. President, the most outrageous thing your opponent has said in the debate tonight?\\n\\nThe President. Well, now, I have to start with a smile, since his kind words to me.\\n\\nI\\'ll tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog, both in this campaign and the one in \\'82. And that is the continued discussion and claim that somehow I am the villain who is going to pull the Social Security checks out from those people who are dependent on them.\\n\\nAnd why I think it is outrageous--first of all, it isn\\'t true. But why it is outrageous is because, for political advantage, every time they do that, they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security, have no place else to turn. And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, \"Is this true? Is someone going to take our check away from us and leave us destitute?\" And I don\\'t think that that should be a part of political dialog.\\n\\nNow, to--I still--I just have a minute here?\\n\\nMs. Walters. You have more time.\\n\\nThe President. Oh, I--\\n\\nMs. Walters. You can keep going.\\n\\nThe President. Okay. All right.\\n\\nNow, Social Security, let\\'s lay it to rest once and for all. I told you never would I do such a thing. But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit. Social Security is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on employer and employee. If you reduce the out-go of Social Security, that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit. It would go into the Social Security Trust Fund. So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit.\\n\\nNow, again, to get to whether I am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldn\\'t work. And then, after it worked, I was told that lowering taxes would increase inflation. And none of these things happened. It is working, and we\\'re going to continue on that same line.\\n\\nAs to what we might do, and find in further savings cuts, no, we\\'re not going to starve the hungry. But we have 2,478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2,000 business people in this country, through the Grace commission, that we\\'re studying right now--and we\\'ve already implemented 17 percent of them-that are recommendations as to how to make government more efficient, more economic.\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. And to keep it even, what remaining question would you most like to see your opponent forced to answer?\\n\\nThe President. Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now, but that in 1976, when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone was panicking about that, he said, no, that he thought it ought to be bigger, because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment. In 1979 he made similar statements, the same effect, that the deficits-there was nothing wrong with having deficits.\\n\\nRemember, there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here. That\\'s got to be paid by our children and grandchildren, too, if we don\\'t do it. And I\\'m hoping we can start some payments on it before we get through here. That\\'s why I want another 4 years.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Well, we have time now, if you\\'d like to answer the President\\'s question, or whatever rebuttal.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Well, we\\'ve just finished almost the whole debate. And the American people don\\'t have the slightest clue about what President Reagan will do about these deficits. [Laughter] And yet, that\\'s the most important single issue of our time.\\n\\nI did support the \\'76 measure that he told about, because we were in a deep recession and we needed some stimulation. But I will say as a Democrat, I was a real piker, Mr. President. In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year. This administration seems to run that every morning. And the result is exactly what we see. This economy is starting to run downhill. Housing is off. Last report on new purchases, it\\'s the lowest since 1982. Growth is a little over 3 percent now. Many people are predicting a recession. And the flow of imports into this country is swamping the American people.\\n\\nWe\\'ve got to deal with this problem, and those of us who want to be your President should tell you now what we\\'re going to do, so you can make a judgment.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Thank you very much. We must stop now. I want to give you time for your closing statements. It\\'s indeed time for that from each of you. We will begin with President Reagan.\\n\\nOh, I\\'m sorry, Mr. Reagan, you had your rebuttal, and I just cut you off because our time is going. You have a chance now for rebuttal before your closing statement. Is that correct?\\n\\nThe President. No, I might as well just go with-\\n\\nMs. Walters. Do you want to go with your--\\n\\nThe President. I don\\'t think so. I\\'m all confused now.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Technically, you did. I have little voices that come in my ear. [Laughter] You don\\'t get those same voices. I\\'m not hearing it from here--I\\'m hearing it from here.\\n\\nThe President. All right.\\n\\nMs. Walters. You have waived your rebuttal. You can go with your closing statement.\\n\\nClosing Statements\\n\\nThe President. Well, we\\'ll include it in that.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Okay.\\n\\nThe President. Four years ago, in similar circumstances to this, I asked you, the American people, a question. I asked: \"Are you better off than you were 4 years before?\" The answer to that obviously was no, and as the result, I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning.\\n\\nNow, maybe I\\'m expected to ask that same question again. I\\'m not going to, because I think that all of you--or not everyone, those people that are in those pockets of poverty and haven\\'t caught up, they couldn\\'t answer the way I would want them to--but I think that most of the people in this country would say, yes, they are better off than they were 4 years ago.\\n\\nThe question, I think, should be enlarged. Is America better off than it was 4 years ago? And I believe the answer to that has to also be \"yes.\" I promised a new beginning. So far, it is only a beginning. If the job were finished, I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job.\\n\\nBut we now have an economy that, for the first time--well, let\\'s put it this way: In the first half of 1980, gross national product was down a minus 3.7 percent. The first half of \\'84 it\\'s up 8 1/2 percent. Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent. Today it is up a plus 4 percent.\\n\\nPersonal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost $3,000 in these 4 years. In 1980--or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8,000 was $500 above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty. By 1980 that same person was $500 below the poverty line.\\n\\nWe have restored much of our economy. With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since 1949. So, there seems to be no shortage of investment capital. We have, as I said, cut the taxes, but we have reduced inflation, and for 2 years now it has stayed down there, not at double digit, but in the range of 4 or below. We believe that we had also promised that we would make our country more secure.\\n\\nYes, we have an increase in the defense budget. But back then we had planes that couldn\\'t fly for lack of spare parts or pilots. We had navy vessels that couldn\\'t leave harbor because of lack of crew or, again, lack of spare parts. Today we\\'re well on our way to a 600-ship navy. We have 543 at present.\\n\\nWe have--our military, the morale is high. I think the people should understand that two-thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary, or pay and pension. And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons. But I am determined that if ever our men are called on, they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons. There has been reference to expensive spare parts, hammers costing $500. Well, we are the ones who found those.\\n\\nI think we\\'ve given the American people back their spirit. I think there\\'s an optimism in the land and a patriotism, and I think that we\\'re in a position once again to heed the words of Thomas Paine, who said: \"We have it in our power to begin the world over again.\"\\n\\nMs. Walters. Thank you, Mr. Reagan.\\n\\nMr. Mondale, the closing words are now yours.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. I want to thank the League of Women Voters and the city of Louisville for hosting this evening\\'s debate. I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate. He didn\\'t have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it.\\n\\nThe President\\'s favorite question is: Are you better off?. Well, if you\\'re wealthy, you\\'re better off. If you\\'re middle income, you\\'re about where you were. And if you\\'re modest income, you\\'re worse off. That\\'s what the economists tell us.\\n\\nBut is that really the question that should be asked? Isn\\'t the real question is will we be better off?. Will our children be better off?. Are we building the future that this nation needs? I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, you\\'ll see that we need new leadership.\\n\\nAre we better of with this arms race? Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens? Are we better off when we de-emphasize our values in human rights? Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt? Would fathers and mothers feel proud of themselves if they loaded their children with debts like this nation is now--over a trillion dollars on the shoulders of our children? Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness?\\n\\nI would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self-interest. I don\\'t think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves. And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited. When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability-confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I don\\'t think that\\'s what America is all about.\\n\\nAmerica is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him. I believe there\\'s fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system.\\n\\nI believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment. And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful. These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price. That\\'s not fair for our future.\\n\\nI think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and we\\'re being pressed harder all the time.\\n\\nI believe in opening doors. We won the Olympics, in part, because we\\'ve had civil rights laws and the laws that prohibit discrimination against women. I have been for those efforts all my life. The President\\'s record is quite different.\\n\\nThe question is our future. President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, \"We are great, but we can be greater.\" We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Thank you, Mr. Mondale. [Applause] Please, we have not finished quite yet.\\n\\nThank you, Mr. Mondale, and thank you, Mr. President. And our thanks to our panel members, as well.\\n\\nAnd so we bring to a close this first of the League of Women Voters Presidential debates of 1984. You two can go at each again in the final League debate on October 21st, in Kansas City, Missouri. And this Thursday night, October 11th, at 9 p.m. eastern daylight time, the Vice President, George Bush, will debate Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro in Philadelphia.\\n\\nAnd I hope that you will all watch once again. No matter what the format is, these debates are very important. We all have an extremely vital decision to make.\\n\\nOnce more, gentlemen, our thanks. Once more, to you, our thanks.\\n\\nNow, this is Barbara Walters wishing you a good evening.'}, {'file': '96_debate_1', 'content': 'Jim Lehrer. Good evening from the Shiley Theatre at the University of San Diego, San Diego, California. I\\'m Jim Lehrer of the \"NewsHour\" on PBS. Welcome to this second 1996 Presidential debate between Senator Bob Dole, the Republican nominee, and President Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee. It is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.\\n\\nWe will follow a townhall-type format tonight. The questions over the next 90 minutes will come from 113 citizens of the greater San Diego area. They were chosen in the past week by the Gallup organization to represent a rough cross-section of voters as to political views, age, gender, and other factors. Each said he or she is undecided about this Presidential race.\\n\\nThey were told to come tonight with questions. Nobody from the Debate Commission or the two campaigns has any idea what those questions are; neither do I. We will all be hearing them for the first time at the same time. I met with this group 3 hours ago, and we spoke only about how it was going to work tonight. They are sitting in five sections. I will call on individuals at random, moving from one section to another with each new question, alternating the questions between the two candidates. My job is to keep things fair and the subjects as clear and as varied as possible.\\n\\nThe rules, drawn by the campaigns, are basically the same as they were for the Hartford and St. Petersburg debates: 90-second answers, 60-second rebuttals, 30-second responses for each question. The candidates are not allowed to question each other directly. There will be 2-minute opening and closing statements. The order for this evening was set by coin toss.\\n\\nWe begin now with Senator Dole and his opening statement.\\n\\nSenator Dole.\\n\\nOpening Statements\\n\\nSenator Bob Dole. Thank you very much, Jim.\\n\\nLet me first give you a sports update: the Braves, one; Cardinals, nothing—early on.\\n\\nI want to thank you and I want to thank everybody here tonight, and I want a special thanks to my wife, Elizabeth, and my daughter, Robin, for their love and support, and thank the people who are listening and watching all over America.\\n\\nIn 20 days, you will help decide who will lead this country into the next century. It\\'s an awesome responsibility. And you must ask yourself, do you know enough about the candidates? You should know as much as possible about each of us. Sometimes the views have been distorted—and millions and millions of dollars in negative advertising spent distorting my views— but I hope tonight you\\'ll get a better feel of who Bob Dole is and what he\\'s all about.\\n\\nAnd I think first you should—I should understand that the question on your mind is, do I understand your problem? But I understand it if—it occurred to me and I might just say that I\\'m from a large family. I\\'ve got lots of relatives, and they\\'re good, average, middle class, hard-working Americans. They live all across the country. They\\'re not all Republicans—maybe all but one. [Laughter]\\n\\nBut in any event, I understand the problems, whether it\\'s two parents working because one has to pay the taxes and one has to provide for the family; whether it\\'s a single parent who just barely pays the pressing bills; or whether you\\'re worried about an education for your children—are they going to the best schools; or whether you\\'re worried about safe playgrounds, drug-free schools, crime-free schools.\\n\\nThis is what this election is all about. And hopefully tonight when we conclude this debate, you will have a better understanding and the viewing and listening audience will have a better understanding. Thank you. [Applause]\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Mr. President, 2 minutes, opening statement.\\n\\nThe President. I was going to applaud, too. [Laughter]\\n\\nWell, thank you, Jim, and thanks to the people of San Diego for giving us this opportunity to have another discussion about the decision we all face in front of people who will make the decision. Again I will say, I\\'ll do my best to make this a discussion of ideas and issues, not insults. What really matters is what happens to your future and what happens to our country as we stand on the brink of a new century, a time of extraordinary possibility.\\n\\nI have a simple philosophy that I\\'ve tried to follow for the last 4 years: Do what creates opportunity for all, what reinforces responsibility from all of us, and what will help us build a community where everybody\\'s got a role to play and a place at the table.\\n\\nCompared to 4 years ago, we\\'re clearly better off. We\\'ve got 10 1/2 million more jobs; the deficit\\'s been reduced by 60 percent; incomes are rising for the first time in a decade; the crime rates, the welfare rolls are falling; we\\'re putting 100,000 more police on the street; 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers have been denied handguns.\\n\\nBut that progress is only the beginning. What we really should focus on tonight is what we still have to do to help the American people make the most of this future that\\'s out there. I think what really matters is what we can do to help build strong families. Strong families need a strong economy. To me, that means we have to go on and balance this budget while we protect Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment.\\n\\nWe should give a tax cut targeted to childrearing and education, to buying a first home and paying for health care. We ought to help protect our kids from drugs and guns and gangs and tobacco. We ought to help move a million people from welfare to work. And we ought to create the finest education system in the world, where every 18-year-old can go on to college and all of our younger children have great educational opportunities. If we do those things, we can build that bridge to the 21st century. That\\'s what I hope to get to talk about tonight.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. All right, let\\'s go now to the first question from this section, and it\\'s for Senator Dole.\\n\\nYes, ma\\'am? Yes?\\n\\nQ. Hello, Senator Dole.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Hi.\\n\\nLeadership To Promote Unity\\n\\nQ. My name is Shannon MacAfee. I\\'m a beginning educator in this country, and I really think it\\'s important what children have to say. They\\'re still very idealistic, and everything they say comes from the heart. I have a quote for you from \"If I Were President,\" compiled by Peggy Gavin. A sixth grader says, \"If I were President, I would think about Abraham Lincoln and George Washington and what they did to make our country great. We should unite the white and black people and people of all cultures. Democrats and Republicans should unite also. We should all come together and think of the best ways to solve the economic problems of our country. I believe that when we are able to come together and stop fighting amongst ourselves, we will get along a lot better.\"\\n\\nThese are the ideals and morals that we are trying to teach our children in these days, yet we don\\'t seem to be practicing them in our Government, in anything. If you are President, how will you begin to practice what we are preaching to our children, the future of our Nation?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, I would say, first of all, I think it\\'s a very good question, and I appreciate the quote from the young man.\\n\\nThere\\'s no doubt about it that many American people have lost their faith in government. They see scandals almost on a daily basis. They see ethical problems in the White House today. They see 900 FBI files of private persons being gathered up by somebody in the White House; nobody knows who hired this man. So there\\'s a great deal of cynicism out there.\\n\\nBut I\\'ve always tried, in whatever I\\'ve done, to bring people together. I said in my acceptance speech in San Diego about 2 months ago that the exits are clearly marked. If you think the Republican Party is someplace for you to come if you\\'re narrow-minded or bigoted or don\\'t like certain people in America, the exits are clearly marked for you to walk out of, as I stand here without compromise because this is the party of Lincoln.\\n\\nI think we have a real obligation, obviously, public officials. I\\'m no longer a public official; I left public life on June 11th of this year. But it is very important. Young people are looking to us. They\\'re looking to us for leadership.\\n\\nThey\\'re watching what we do, what we say, what we promise, and what we finally deliver. And I would think—it seems to me that there are opportunities here. When I\\'m President of the United States, I will keep my word. My word is my bond.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Mr. President?\\n\\nThe President. One of the reasons that I ran for President, Sandy, is because not just children, a lot of grownups felt that way. If you remember, 4 years ago we had not only rising unemployment but a lot of rising cynicism. I\\'d never worked in Washington as an elected official. It seemed to me that most of the arguments were partisan: Republican, Democrat; left, right; liberal, conservative. That\\'s why I said tonight I\\'m for opportunity, responsibility, and community. And we\\'ve gotten some real progress in the last 4 years. I\\'ve also done everything I could at every moment of division in this country—after Oklahoma City, when these churches were burned—to bring people together and remind people that we are stronger because of our diversity. We have to respect one another.\\n\\nYou mentioned Washington and Lincoln; they were Presidents at historic times. This is an historic time. It\\'s important that we go beyond those old partisan arguments and focus on people and their future. When we do that, instead of shutting the Government down over a partisan fight on the budget, we\\'re a better country, and that\\'s why we\\'re making progress now.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Senator?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, bringing people together again is obviously a responsibility we all have. I know you do it. Everybody here does it. You do a lot of things nobody knows about. I have a little foundation for the disabled called the Dole Foundation. We\\'ve raised about $10 million. We don\\'t talk about it. We try to help people with disabilities. We bring them back into the mainstream of public life.\\n\\nSo it seems to me that there\\'s also a public trust. When you\\'re the President of the United States, you have a public trust, and you have to keep that public trust, as George Washington did and as Abraham Lincoln did. And I think now that trust is being violated. And it seems to me we ought to face up to it, and the President ought to say tonight that he\\'s not going to pardon anybody that he was involved in business with who might implicate him later on.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. All right, the next question from this section right here. Right there in the middle, sir. Yes, sir?\\n\\nHealth Care\\n\\nQ. Dr. Robert Berkeley; I\\'m a cardiologist from Fallbrook, California. Mr. President, I\\'d like to know if you\\'d please explain your plans for—in a substantive fashion, for addressing the problems with the health care system in our country.\\n\\nThe President. I will. First of all, let me say what we have done: In the last 4 years, we\\'ve worked hard to promote more competition to bring down the rate of inflation in health care costs without eroding health care quality. The Government pays for Medicare and Medicaid, as you know, and that\\'s very important.\\n\\nSecondly, we\\'ve added a million more children to the ranks of the insured through the Medicaid program. We have protected 25 million people through the passage of the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that says you can\\'t lose your health insurance if you change jobs or if someone in your family\\'s been sick. We just recently ended those drive-by deliveries, saying people couldn\\'t be kicked out of the hospital by insurance companies when they\\'d just had babies. So this is—that\\'s a good start.\\n\\nIn the next 4 years, I want to focus on the following things: Number one, add another million children to the insured ranks through the Medicaid program; number two, keep working with the States, as we are now, to add 2.2 million more people to the insurance system; number three, cover people who are between jobs for up to 6 months—that could protect 3 million families, 700,000 kids; and number four, make sure we protect the integrity of the Medicare program and the Medicaid program and not do anything in cutting costs which would cause hundreds of hospitals to close, as could have been the case if the $270 billion Medicare cut that I vetoed had been enacted into law.\\n\\nSenator Dole. First, let me say there you go again, Mr. President, talking about a Medicare cut. Now, I\\'ve heard you say this time after time, and I\\'ve heard you say on one TV appearance, \"The media made me do it.\" You were trying to defend your cut, which was not a cut either—a reduction in the growth of spending. And we always had at least 7 percent. You\\'ve said publicly that it\\'s now 3 times the rate of inflation, we ought to cut the growth to twice the rate of inflation. That\\'s about where we are now. So let\\'s stop talking about cutting Medicare. In my economic plan we increase it 39 percent.\\n\\nDon\\'t forget what he tried to do with health care: 17 new taxes, spend $1.5 trillion, 50 new bureaucracies. Can you believe that? You couldn\\'t even have been a cardiologist because they had quotas. You had—you couldn\\'t—you\\'re a cardiologist; it wouldn\\'t affect you. But if somebody wanted to be a cardiologist 10 years from now, you\\'d have to be certain that you complied with some of the rules in this extreme medical plan the Government was going to take over for all Americans. There are things we can do like the Kassebaum bill, that retains many provisions I authored, to cover preexisting—existing—portability. And there are other things we can do. We still need to cover about 20 million people and a lot of children.\\n\\nThe President. I don\\'t have time in 30 seconds to respond to fix all that. But let me just say, the American Hospital Association said that the budget I vetoed could have closed 700 hospitals, not me. And on a per-person basis, it did cut way below the rate of inflation in medical costs.\\n\\nBut the important thing is, what are we going to do now? We need to help people who are between jobs. We need to cover more kids. We need to provide more preventive care. My balanced budget covers mammograms for ladies on—women on Medicare and also gives respite care to the million-plus families who have someone with Alzheimer\\'s. These things are paid for in the balanced budget plan. It will move us forward.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. The next question is for Senator Dole from here. Yes, sir?\\n\\nArmed Forces\\n\\nQ. Senator Dole, my name is Jason Milligan, active-duty military and a small-business owner. And my question is, what is your position on closing the gap between military and civilian pay scales?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Jason, I appreciate that very much, being a former military man myself.\\n\\nYou know, we have 17,000 men and women today wearing our uniform that receive food stamps. It shouldn\\'t happen in America. We have men and women wearing our uniform in substandard housing. It shouldn\\'t happen in America. And it\\'s time we take a look at the pay scales. You did get a 3 percent increase this year, but that\\'s not enough.\\n\\nIf we\\'re going to ask young men and young women to protect us and defend us around the world, and we\\'ve had more deployments under this administration than any time in history— 50 times we deployed troops around the world. Every time you do that, you take a risk—somebody you know, maybe your son, maybe your grandson, maybe somebody else. But I think anybody who wears a uniform is a great American. Remember Vietnam, remember when people almost used to walk across the street rather than have contact with somebody who was in Vietnam—that\\'s all behind us now, and it should be behind us—and the forgotten war, the Korean war. But I guess, I can just answer you very plainly, Jason: Thank you for doing what you\\'re doing. America owes you a debt of gratitude.\\n\\nThe President. May I ask you a question? What kind of—which service are you in?\\n\\nQ. I\\'m in the United States Navy, sir.\\n\\nThe President. And what kind of small business do you have?\\n\\nQ. I have an Amway business.\\n\\nThe President. Good for you. Well, let me say—Senator Dole mentioned this. I just signed a bill that we got through Congress to increase the amount of pay increase we could give for military personnel and to make sure the pay increase this year was above the rate of inflation. I also had presented to the Congress, and they adopted, a large package of quality-of-life improvements which are very important. I\\'ve spent a lot of time talking to military families, as well as military members, all over the world and in bases all across the United States. And I became convinced, after talking to the families and the personnel in uniform, that we needed to not only have the pay raise but we needed to invest more in child care, housing, and other things to support families, especially when there are longer deployments because of the downsizing of the military.\\n\\nSo we\\'re going to do better, and we\\'ll do better still. But this is a commitment I think that all Americans share, without regard to party.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Senator Dole?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, Jason, I don\\'t disagree with anything the President said except he waited 4 years to do these things. And my view is it ought to be—it\\'ll be done on day one.\\n\\nWe\\'ll start working on it on day one in the Dole-Kemp administration. This is important. Now, we only have 10 divisions now; we used to have 18. We had 25 fighter wings; we\\'re down to 13. We had 536 ships; we\\'re down to 336 ships. I mean, we\\'ve cut defense spending too much in the first place. The President told you in \\'92 he would cut it $67 billion; he cut $112 billion. So we\\'re right on the edge right now. But the last thing we ought to do is make those who wear the uniform sacrifice.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Next question here for President Clinton. Yes, ma\\'am, here on the front row.\\n\\nMiddle East Peace Process\\n\\nQ. President Clinton, my name is Cecily Kelly. Yesterday Yasser Arafat said in Palestine that he thinks the key to success in the Middle East is the commitment of Americans. Would you, as President, send American troops to Israel or the West Bank as peacekeepers?\\n\\nThe President. Let me just take 2 seconds of my time, because I\\'m the Commander in Chief, to respond to one thing that was said. I propose to spend $1.6 trillion on defense between now and the year 2002. And there\\'s less than one percent difference between my budget and the Republican budget on defense.\\n\\nNow, on the Middle East, as you know, I\\'ve worked very hard for peace in the Middle East. The agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis was signed at the White House. And the agreement, the peace treaty with Jordan, I went to Jordan to sign that, to be there. But— and I think the United States could do whatever we reasonably can.\\n\\nI can say this: I do not believe Yasser Arafat wants us to send troops to the West Bank. We have never been asked to send troops to the West Bank.\\n\\nI saw the agreement that Prime Minister Rabin and Yasser Arafat signed on the West Bank. It had 26 separate maps they had to sign, literally thousands of delineations of who would do what on the West Bank. And I believe if the parties will get together and in a good faith manner make that agreement, that they\\'ll be able to do it. We cannot impose a peace on the Middle East.\\n\\nMy position has always been that the job of the United States was to minimize the risks of peace. You know, if they ask me to be part of some monitoring force—as we are in the Sinai and have been since 1978 to monitor the peace between Egypt and Israel—frankly, I would have to think about it; I would have to see what they wanted to do. But I don\\'t believe that will be the request. I think what Mr. Arafat wants us to do is to make sure that everybody honors the agreements they\\'ve already made. That\\'s why I brought the leaders to Washington a few days ago. I think they will, and I think we\\'ll get there. Don\\'t be too discouraged.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, let me, Jason, come back to you a minute because there is a big difference in the defense budget. We had $7 billion this year, and $10 billion more than the President. He puts his money in the out years— even if he were reelected, you know, he\\'d be gone before anything happened. And nothing\\'s going to happen, because we don\\'t have modernization now. If we don\\'t build more B-2 bombers in California—and we lost about 500,000 jobs out in California because of this devastation, these big, big cuts. We had to make cuts; we didn\\'t have to make the cuts the President promised he\\'d make and then he doubled. And so I think we need to go back and take a look. We\\'re increasing defense reasonably, not too much but we are increasing defense some, because we want to be prepared in case somebody here gets called up, Jason.\\n\\nI would say I didn\\'t hear what Yasser Arafat had to say, but I don\\'t want to—you know, I think foreign policy is something we want to be very careful about. And I\\'m not here to argue about the President on some ongoing foreign policy matter. What I want the President to do, and I think he may have done it in his last statement, is call for an unconditional end to the violence and have the parties keep on talking as they should talk and have a resolution. The last thing we want to do is commit more forces anywhere.\\n\\nBut let\\'s sort of keep this out of politics, because it\\'s pretty dicey right now.\\n\\nThe President. When the change of government occurred in Israel, the people of Israel were saying, \"We don\\'t want to abandon the peace process. We want more security.\" Then, a lot of mutual distrust developed. A lot of things happened which maybe shouldn\\'t have happened.\\n\\nWhen I asked Yasser Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to Washington and got them together and they talked alone for 3 hours, I was convinced that they had to have a chance to make that peace. Again, I\\'d say if they ask us to play some reasonable role, I don\\'t know how I would respond. It would depend entirely on what they ask us to do. But the real secret there is for them to abide by the agreements they\\'ve made and find a way to trust each other. And they\\'re going to have to spend some time and trust each other.\\n\\nPrime Minister Rabin gave his life believing that that trust could be materialized, and I still think it can be.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. All right, next question from this section, and it is for Senator Dole. Back in the back. Yes, sir, right there. Yes, sir.\\n\\nTobacco\\n\\nQ. Senator Dole, Oscar Delgado.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Oscar.\\n\\nQ. Ex-smoker for 30 years. About 30 years ago I was a pack-plus-a-day man, okay? You mentioned in a statement, you said some time ago that you didn\\'t think nicotine was addictive. Would you care to—you still hold to that statement, or do you wish to recant or explain yourself?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Oh, that—that\\'s very easy. My record going back to 1965 in the Congress, the first vote we had was whether or not you should put a little notice on cigarettes that they may be dangerous—I voted—I voted for everything since that time.\\n\\nIn fact, in 1992 we had a bill come before us that all the States had to comply or they\\'re going to lose certain money. We sent it to the Clinton administration for implementation. They waited 3 1/2 years. And during that period about 3,000 young kids every day started smoking. If you add it up, that\\'s about 3 million—not until again 1996.\\n\\nI don\\'t want anybody to smoke. My brother probably died partly because of cigarettes. I was asked a technical question: Are they addictive? Maybe they—they probably are addictive. I don\\'t know; I\\'m not a doctor. You shouldn\\'t smoke. You ought to be glad you quit, Oscar— 30 years?\\n\\nQ. Yes.\\n\\nSenator Dole. And it seems to me that what we need to do is to talk about not only tobacco but drugs, because drug use in 12- and 17year-olds has doubled in this administration, the last 44 months. Marijuana use is up 141 percent; cocaine use, up 160 percent. They\\'re your kids. It\\'s all happened in this administration because they cut funding and they cut interdiction.\\n\\nWhen I\\'m President of the United States, we\\'re going to use the National Guard and whatever resources we need to stop some of the drugs coming into America. If you stop the drugs, nobody is going to use the drugs. So don\\'t smoke, don\\'t drink, don\\'t use drugs. Just don\\'t do it.\\n\\nThe President. Oscar, the question of what the Federal Government should do to limit the access of tobacco to young people is one of the biggest differences between Senator Dole and me.\\n\\nWe did propose a regulation 6 months after I became President under the law he mentioned. It simply says all these States—it made it illegal for kids to smoke—now they have to try harder if they want to keep getting Federal funds. Then we took comments, as we always do, and there were tens of thousands of comments about how we ought to do it. That\\'s what drug it out.\\n\\nMeanwhile, we started, also in \\'93, to look into whether cigarettes were addictive enough for the Federal Food and Drug Administration to ban the ability of cigarette companies to advertise, market, and distribute tobacco products to our kids. No President had ever taken on the tobacco lobby before. I did. Senator Dole opposed me. He went down and made a speech to people who were on his side, saying that I did the wrong thing. I think I did the right thing.\\n\\nOn drugs, I have repeatedly said drugs are wrong and illegal and can kill you. We have strengthened enforcement, and everybody in San Diego knows we\\'ve strengthened control of the border. We\\'ve done a lot more; I hope we get a chance to talk about it.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, they also know, if they live in San Diego, Mr. President, if you\\'re caught with 125 pounds of marijuana or less, you go back to Mexico; you\\'re not prosecuted. You have a U.S. Attorney here that sends them back home. So I think that\\'s pretty important. That\\'s a lot of marijuana. That\\'s a big supply.\\n\\nBut don\\'t—you know, don\\'t get into this smokescreen here, Oscar. The President, in the election year, decided, \"Well, I ought to do something. I haven\\'t done anything on drugs. I\\'ve been AWOL for 44 months. So let\\'s take on smoking.\"\\n\\nBut see, they haven\\'t even done it. They haven\\'t said what\\'s going to happen, whether they\\'re going to have it declared addictive; it\\'s going to apply just to—once it\\'s a drug, does it apply only to teenagers or to everybody in America?\\n\\nNobody should smoke, young or old. But particularly, young people should not smoke. And my record is there. It\\'s been there. I\\'ve voted 8, 10 times since 1965.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. The next question is for President Clinton, and it comes from right here. Yes, sir?\\n\\nSocial Security and Medicare\\n\\nQ. President Clinton, my name is Jack Fleck. I\\'m a retired Air Force pilot. Sir, it\\'s officially forecast that our annual Medicare and Social Security deficits are measured in the trillions of dollars next century. Depending upon who you listen to, Social Security will be bankrupt in either 2025 or 2030. I feel this is grossly unfair, especially to our younger generations, who are losing faith in the system.\\n\\nMy question is this: Assuming you agree that our entitlement programs are on an unsustainable course, what specific reforms do you propose?\\n\\nThe President. First of all, they\\'re two different things. Social Security and Medicare are entirely different in terms of the financial stabilities. Let\\'s talk about them separately.\\n\\nSocial Security is stable until, as you pointed out, at least the third decade of the next century. But we\\'d like to have a Social Security fund that has about 70 years of life instead of about 30 years of life.\\n\\nWhat we have to do is simply to make some adjustments that take account of the fact that the baby boomers, people like me, are bigger in number than the people that went just before us and the people that come just after us. And I think what we\\'ll plainly do is what we did in 1983, when Senator Dole served—and this is something I think he did a good job on— when he served on the Social Security Commission and they made some modest changes in Social Security to make sure that it would be alive and well into the 21st century. And we will do that. It\\'s obvious that there are certain things that have to be done, and there are 50 to 60 different options. And a bipartisan commission, to take it out of politics, will make recommendations and build support for the people.\\n\\nMedicare is different. Medicare needs help now. I have proposed a budget which would put 10 years on the life of the Medicare Trust Fund; that\\'s more than it\\'s had a lot of the time for the last 20 years.\\n\\nIt would save a lot of money through more managed care but giving more options, more preventive care, and lowering the inflation rate in the prices we\\'re paying providers without having the kind of big premium increases and outof-pocket costs that the budget I vetoed would provide. Then that will give us 10 years to do with Medicare what we\\'re going to do with Social Security: have a bipartisan group look at what we have to do to save it when the baby boomers retire. But now we ought to pass this budget now and put 10 years on it right away so no one has to worry about it.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, again, you know, if you\\'re somebody thinking about the future, I think it\\'s fair to say that it\\'ll be—we\\'ll work it out. I mean, this is a political year, and the President\\'s playing politics with Medicare. But after this year\\'s over we\\'ll resolve it just as we did with Social Security in 1983. It was a nonpartisan commission. Ronald Reagan got together with Tip O\\'Neill and Howard Baker—two Republicans and one Democrat—and they formed a commission. I was on that commission. We resolved—we rescued Social Security. We suggested—I think it\\'s been over a year ago now— we do the same with Medicare, and the White House called it a gimmick. Now last week, I guess it was, Donna Shalala said, \"Well, we\\'ll cut Medicare a hundred billion, and we\\'ll appoint a commission.\"\\n\\nIt will probably have to be done by a commission. Take it out of politics. I think if I were a senior citizen I\\'d be a little fed up with all these ads scaring seniors, scaring veterans, and scaring students about education. But when you don\\'t have any ideas, when you don\\'t have any agenda, and all you have is fear, that\\'s all you can use. We have ideas in the Dole-Kemp campaign, and we\\'ll rescue Medicare as we did Social Security.\\n\\nThe President. Their idea was to have the poorest seniors in the country pay $270 more a year this year. Their idea was to budget— that the American Hospital Association said could close 700 hospitals. Their idea was to charge everybody more out-of-pocket costs in their budget that I vetoed—not in an election year, sir, I told them in early \\'95.\\n\\nSenator Dole said 30 years ago he was one of 12 people that voted against Medicare and he was proud of it. A year ago he said, \"I was right then; I knew it wouldn\\'t work.\" American seniors have the highest life expectancy in the world. We need to reform it, not wreck it.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Next question from here, and it\\'s for Senator Dole. Yes, ma\\'am, right here.\\n\\nQ. Me?\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Yes.\\n\\nWelfare Reform\\n\\nQ. Senator Dole, my name is Suzanne Gonzalez, and I would like to know what you are— what would be your first step in reforming welfare.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, we\\'ve taken the first step. We took it three steps. Twice we sent welfare reform to the President, and he vetoed it. On the third time we sent welfare reform to the President, he signed it but announced he would change it next year. And the Vice President said they were going to do something else through the line item veto, which I\\'ve never understood, but that\\'s sort of inside baseball.\\n\\nWhat we need to do is make certain we try to return people to work. And I\\'m standing here as someone who a long time ago—as the county attorney in Russell, Kansas, one of our jobs every month was to go through all the welfare checks and sign them. And three of those checks were my grandparents\\'. So I know what it\\'s like to have to look welfare head-on.\\n\\nObviously some people are going to need help. This is the United States of America. You\\'re not going to go without food, and you\\'re not going to go without medical care. This is America. But at the same time, if you want to get off Medicare, get back in the mainstream, we\\'re going to provide jobs. We\\'re going to say you have a 5-year limit that you can be on welfare. You\\'ve got 2 years to look for a job. We provided more money for day care in the bill that passed the Senate and was vetoed. Then it came back, and the President signed pretty much the same bill.\\n\\nBut this is an important issue. I don\\'t think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants. I mean, it puts a heavy burden on a State like—except for emergencies. It puts a heavy burden on States like California. It costs California taxpayers $3 billion a year.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. President Clinton?\\n\\nSenator Dole. I\\'ll get out of your way here.\\n\\nThe President. It\\'s illegal right now and has been for years for illegal immigrants to get welfare benefits.\\n\\nLet me say that this is one of the most important issues in the world to me. I started working on welfare reform in 1980 because I was sick of seeing people trapped in a system that was increasingly physically isolating them and making their kids more vulnerable to get in trouble. So I\\'d been working on it when I was a Governor for a long time.\\n\\nWhen I became President, I used the authority I had in this law to get out from under certain Federal rules to help States move people to work. We\\'ve reduced the welfare rolls by 2 million already. Now I\\'ve got a plan with this new welfare reform law to work with the private sector to give employers specific tax incentives to hire people off welfare and to do some other things which will create more jobs in the private sector, at least a million, to move more people from welfare to work. It\\'s very important. And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more. There is not a more important issue.\\n\\nI still remember a woman that I met 10 years ago who said she wanted to get off welfare so her kids could tell—give an answer when they say, \"What does your mother do for a job?\" I met that woman again. She\\'s got four kids. One\\'s got a good job; one\\'s studying to be a doctor; one\\'s in technical school; one\\'s an honor student in high school. I want to make more people like that woman, Lillie Harden. So I\\'ve got a plan to do it. And it\\'s just beginning.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, another thing we can do—we talk about growth—we\\'ve got a great economic package which I hope we\\'ll discuss later: across the board tax cut; child credits, $500 per child under 18; reduce the capital gains rate; create more jobs and opportunities for people on and off welfare.\\n\\nAnd we have other provisions: less litigation. The trial lawyers—big supporters of the President—the trial lawyers, of course they like lawsuits, so every time they have a bill that they want vetoed, the President vetoes it for them.\\n\\nWe\\'ve got to understand in America that we\\'ve got to have growth, create more jobs and more opportunities in the private sector. The President takes credit for all of these people off welfare—the Governors did that. Federal Government doesn\\'t do that. And the Government doesn\\'t create jobs, they\\'re created in the private sector.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. This section, question? Yes, ma\\'am, on the back row. This is for the President.\\n\\nCapital Gains Tax\\n\\nQ. Mr. President, my name is Pamela Johnson, and I\\'m a landlord. My question is, does your party have any future plans to reduce the capital gains tax, especially for retired Americans?\\n\\nThe President. First of all, we have a big plan to reduce the capital gains tax when people sell their homes. Part of my tax package, which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains for people when they sell their home, which I think is the biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans.\\n\\nWe also have a capital gains now for people that invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for 5 years. It was part of our other economic plan. And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system.\\n\\nI think the most important thing to emphasize, though, is that we also have to help people in other ways to build a stronger economy. And we can\\'t have any tax cut that\\'s not paid for. One of the big differences between Senator Dole and myself is that I told you how I\\'m going to pay for every penny of the tax cuts I recommend. We\\'ve worked hard to bring this deficit down, and that\\'s helped people in the real estate business, because the interest rates are lower. We\\'ve got homeownership at a 15year high. We\\'ve got this country going in the right direction.\\n\\nSo we can have a tax cut, but my priority would be to help the families who need it with childrearing and education and buying a firsttime home and helping for health care costs. So from your business, helping in buying the first-time home, exempting the capital gains on the sale of the home would be the most important things that you asked about. Thank you, Pamela.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Senator Dole.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, Pamela, what the President didn\\'t tell you is that all his tax cuts expire at the year 2000, but all his increases go on forever. That\\'s the liberal approach. You know, give you a little tax cut, give you a couple of years, then make the tax increases go on forever. So the net tax increase in his plan is somewhere between $60 billion and $80 billion.\\n\\nWe have in the Dole-Kemp economic plan, unless your home is worth over $500,000—and if it is, I appreciate it, congratulate you—but in any event, no tax. And it\\'s a good idea. They saw it, and they picked it up and put in theirs, but it\\'s only temporary. Ours is permanent.\\n\\nOurs is a good plan: create jobs and opportunities; capital gains rate, cut it in half, cut it from 28 percent to 14 percent. There are $7 trillion in assets locked up in America. If we cut the capital gains rate—I\\'m told every day— I got a letter from a former constituent in Kansas saying, \"I want to sell property in California, put it in my business in Kansas. I can\\'t because the capital gains rate is too high.\"\\n\\nWe need to get the economy going. That will help Social Security. That will create more jobs. That will help people who want to get off welfare. It\\'s the American way.\\n\\nThe President. Before Senator Dole left the Senate, he and Mr. Gingrich also were recommending that we pass these tax cuts only insofar as we could pay for them. And we all assume that the tax cuts will be permanent, but we have to prove we can pay for them.\\n\\nAfter he left the Senate, we abandoned that. That\\'s why most experts say that this tax scheme will blow a huge hole in the deficit, raise interest rates, and weaken the economy. And that will take away all the benefits of the tax cut with a weaker economy. That\\'s why we have to balance the budget. And I\\'ll tell you how I\\'m going to pay for anything I promise you, line by line. You should expect that from both of us.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. All right. The next question is for Senator Dole. Yes, ma\\'am, right there.\\n\\nResponding to American Youth\\n\\nQ. My name is Melissa Lydeana, and I\\'m a third-year student out at UC-San Diego. And I just want to say that it\\'s a great honor representing the voices of America. My question is concerning you, Mr. Dole, all the controversy regarding your age. How do you feel you can respond to young voices of America today and tomorrow?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, I think age is very—you know, wisdom comes from age, experience, and intelligence. And if you have some of each— and I have some age, some experience, some intelligence—[laughter]—that adds up to wisdom.\\n\\nI think it also is a strength; it\\'s an advantage. And I have a lot of young people work in my office, work in my campaign. This is about America. This is about—somebody said earlier, one of the first questions, we\\'re together. It\\'s one America, one nation.\\n\\nI\\'m looking at our economic plan because I\\'m concerned about the future for young people. I\\'m looking about drugs. The President\\'s been AWOL for 4 years. I\\'m looking about crime. He\\'ll claim credit now for crime going down, but it happened because mayors and Governors and others have brought crime down. Rudy Giuliani, the mayor of New York, brought crime down 25 percent just in New York City, but of course the President will take credit for that.\\n\\nMy view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education. This year the Republican Congress, as far as student loans, went from 24 billion to 36 billion over the next 6 years— a 50 percent increase; the highest appropriation ever, $6 billion for Pell grants. Very, very important. And we also raised the amount of each Pell grant.\\n\\nIn our economic plan, the $500 child credit can be used for young people. Rolled over and over and over—of course, not this age, but if you have a child 2 years old, 7 percent interest, it would be worth about $18,000 by the time that child was ready for college.\\n\\nThe President. I can only tell you that I don\\'t think Senator Dole is too old to be President. It\\'s the age of his ideas that I question.\\n\\nYou\\'re almost not old enough to remember this, but we\\'ve tried this before, promising people an election-year tax cut that\\'s not paid for——\\n\\nSenator Dole. We tried it last time you ran.\\n\\nThe President. ——telling you you can have everything you got—and let me just say this: Did you hear him say the Congress just voted to increase student loans and scholarships? They did, after he left. The last budget he led cut Pell grants, cut student loans. I vetoed it when they shut the Government down.\\n\\nMy plan would give students a dollar-for-dollar reduction for the cost of the typical community college tuition, a $10,000 deduction a year for the cost of college tuition, would let families save in an IRA and withdraw tax-free to pay for the cost of education. And it\\'s all paid for.\\n\\nMy whole administration is about your future, it\\'s about what the 21st century is going to be like for you. And I hope you\\'ll look at the ideas in it.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, when you don\\'t have any ideas, I guess you say the other person\\'s ideas are old. As I said earlier, they don\\'t have any ideas. Their idea is to raise taxes and spend more money. That\\'s the liberal philosophy. If that\\'s what you like, you\\'ve got a perfect candidate.\\n\\nPresident Clinton came to California in 1992 and said, \"The centerpiece in my first 4 years is going to be a middle class tax cut.\" Now, to all you who got that tax cut, congratulations, because you got a big tax increase. You got a $265 billion tax increase. And he stands here and says politicians who make promises like that ought to be ignored. Well, he made the promise.\\n\\nI keep my word, and you\\'ll have a tax cut. It will help you in whatever you\\'re going to do in the next few years. Thank you.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Next question is for President Clinton, and it\\'s from—yes, ma\\'am? Yes?\\n\\nAffirmative Action\\n\\nQ. Hello. My name is Chessie Sanders, and my question is do you feel that America has grown enough and has educated itself enough to totally cut out affirmative action?\\n\\nThe President. No, ma\\'am, I don\\'t. I am against quotas; I\\'m against giving anybody any kind of preference for something they\\'re not qualified for, but because I still believe that there is some discrimination and that not everybody has an opportunity to prove they are qualified, I favor the right kind of affirmative action.\\n\\nI\\'ve done more to eliminate programs—affirmative action programs that I didn\\'t think were fair and to tighten others up than my predecessors have since affirmative action has been around, but I have also worked hard to give people a chance to prove that they are qualified.\\n\\nLet me just give you some examples. We\\'ve doubled the number of loans from the Small Business Administration, tripled the number of loans to women business people—no one unqualified. Everybody had to meet the standards. We\\'ve opened 260,000 new jobs in the military to women since I\\'ve been President, but the Joint Chiefs say we\\'re stronger and more competent and solid than ever.\\n\\nLet me give you another example of what I mean. To me, affirmative action is making that extra effort. It\\'s sort of like what Senator Dole did when he sponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act that said to certain stores, \"Okay, you\\'ve got to make it accessible to people with wheelchairs.\" We weren\\'t guaranteeing anything—anybody anything except the chance to prove they were qualified, the chance to prove that they could do it.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s why I must say I agree with General Colin Powell that we\\'re not there yet. We ought to keep making those extra-effort affirmative action programs the law and the policy of the land.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Senator Dole.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, we may not be there yet, but we\\'re not going to get there by giving preferences and quotas. I supported that route for some time, and again, I think it gets back to experience—a little experience, a little age, a little intelligence. And I noticed that nobody was really benefiting except a very small group at the top. The average person wasn\\'t benefiting. People who had the money were benefiting. People who got all the jobs were benefiting.\\n\\nIt seems to me that we ought to support the California civil rights initiative. It ought to be not based on gender or ethnicity or color or disability. I\\'m disabled. I shouldn\\'t have a preference. I would like to have one in this race, come to think of it. But I don\\'t get one. Maybe we can work that out. I get a 10-point spot. [Laughter]\\n\\nThis is America. No discrimination. Discrimination ought to be punished, but there ought to be equal opportunity. We ought to reach out and make certain everybody has a chance to participate. Equal opportunity, but we cannot guarantee equal results in America. That\\'s not how America became the greatest country on the face of the Earth.\\n\\nThe President. I have never supported quotas. I\\'ve always been against them. They don\\'t favor equal results. But I do favor making sure everybody has a chance to prove they\\'re competent. The reason I have opposed that initiative is because I\\'m afraid it will end those extra-effort programs.\\n\\nAgain I say think of the American with Disabilities Act. Make an effort to put a ramp up there so someone in a wheelchair can get up. You don\\'t guarantee that they get the job; you guarantee they have a chance to prove they\\'re competent.\\n\\nAnd as I\\'ve said, this is not a partisan thing with me. General Powell, Colin Powell said the same thing. He fears that the initiative would take away the extra-effort programs. No preferences to unqualified people, no quotas, but don\\'t give up on making an extra effort till you\\'re sure everybody has a chance to prove they\\'re qualified.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. All right, the next question is for Senator Dole, and it comes from this section right here. The back row, there, in the blue shirt. Yes, sir.\\n\\nSenator Dole\\'s Tax Cut Proposal\\n\\nQ. My name\\'s Tim David. I\\'m a mechanical engineer. Senator Dole, how do you reduce taxes and balance the budget?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Oh, I\\'m glad you asked.\\n\\nThe President. So am I. I am too.\\n\\nSenator Dole. What\\'s your first name? Tim?\\n\\nI first want to say the President didn\\'t quite give you all the stuff on quotas, because the Justice Department entered what we call the Piscataway case up in New Jersey. It\\'s pretty clear that was a quota case. And just because one teacher was white and one teacher was black and they had the same qualification, you know, they decided who would stay there. It shouldn\\'t be that way.\\n\\nNow, the President can say, well, he wants to mend it, not end it. There are 168 Federal programs that allow quotas. He ended one.\\n\\nNow this economic package, Tim, I\\'m glad you asked because you look like the type that might be able to benefit from the 15 percent, across-the-board tax cut and $500-per-child tax credit or, you know, estate tax relief, which you\\'re not interested in right now, but capital gains rate reduction—if you\\'re taking care of an elderly parent, you get a $1,000 deduction. We think that\\'s very important because a lot of people take care of their parents.\\n\\nHow do we pay for it? We\\'re going to have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, which the President opposed and defeated. He twisted arms, got six Democrats to vote with him. We lost by one vote. We\\'re going to balance the budget by the year 2002.\\n\\nThe President wants to spend 20 percent more over the next 6 years; I want to spend 14 percent more and give that 6 percent back to the people. Remember, it\\'s your money. It\\'s not his money, and it\\'s not my money. It\\'s your money, and you shouldn\\'t have to apologize for wanting to keep all you can of it, but he ought to apologize for wanting to take more and more. He wants to give you sort of a Government tax cut which really doesn\\'t mean anything.\\n\\nThe President. You know, one of the responsibilities of growing older, it seems to me, is being able to tell people something they may not want to hear just because it\\'s truth. When they had a $250 billion tax scheme—that is half the size of this one, this one is 550—they passed a budget that had $270 billion in Medicare cuts, the first education cuts in history, cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent, took away the guarantee of quality standards in nursing homes, took away the guarantee of health care to folks with disabilities.\\n\\nDon\\'t take my word for this. The Economist magazine polled lots of economists. Seven Nobel Prize winners have said, if this tax scheme passes, it will require huge cuts—40 percent— in the environment, in law enforcement, in education. It will require bigger cuts in Medicare than I vetoed last time. My targeted tax cut gives tax cuts for education, childrearing, buying a first-time home, paying for health care costs, and it\\'s paid for. And I\\'ve told you how I\\'ll pay for it. He won\\'t tell you because he can\\'t.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Your targeted tax cut, Mr. President, never hits anybody. That\\'s the problem with it. Nobody ever gets it.\\n\\nBut I must say I\\'m a little offended by this word \"scheme.\" You talked about—last time you talked about a risky scheme, and then Vice President Gore repeated it about 10 times in St. Petersburg. If I have anything in politics, it\\'s my word. My colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, will tell you that Bob Dole kept his word. I\\'m going to keep my word to you. I\\'m going to keep my word to the American people.\\n\\nWe\\'re going to cut taxes and balance the budget. We\\'re not going to touch Medicare. It\\'s going to grow 39 percent, and Social Security is going to grow 34 percent.\\n\\nNow, the President doesn\\'t have any ideas so he\\'s out trashing ours. This isn\\'t going to blow a hole in the deficit. He promised you a tax cut in 1992, and if you got one, you ought to vote for him.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Sir.\\n\\nThe next question is for the President.\\n\\nYes, sir, right there—white shirt.\\n\\nFamily and Medical Leave Act\\n\\nQ. My name is Dwayne Burns. I\\'m a martial arts instructor and a father. Mr. President, could you outline any plans you have to expand the family leave act?\\n\\nThe President. Thank you.\\n\\nWell, first let me say that I signed the family leave act. It was my very first bill, and I\\'m very proud of it because it symbolizes what I think we ought to be doing.\\n\\nI don\\'t take credit for all the good things that have happened in America, but I take credit for what I\\'ve tried to do to work with others to make good things happen.\\n\\nThe most important good things that happen in America happen in families. Just about every family I know, the main concern is how am I going to succeed at work and still do right by my children? Family and medical leave has let 12 million families take a little time off for the birth of a child or a family illness without losing their job. I\\'d like to see it expanded in two ways: I\\'d like to say you can also take a little time off without losing your job to go to a regular parent-teacher conference or to go to a regular doctor\\'s appointment with a family member; I\\'d also like to see the overtime laws change so that we could have some more flextime so that at the discretion of the worker— the worker—if you earn overtime you could decide whether you want that time to be taken in cash or in time with your family if you\\'ve got a family problem.\\n\\nI never go anywhere, it seems like, where I don\\'t meet somebody who\\'s benefited from the family leave law. In Longview, Texas, the other day, I met a woman who was almost in tears because she had been able to keep her job while spending time with her husband who had cancer. One of the people who\\'s here with me today met a woman in the airport saying that her son just was able to be present at the birth of his child because of the family leave law.\\n\\nSo yes, I think it should be expanded. We have to help people succeed at home and at work.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, 88 percent of the people the President claims, or 11 million, are already covered. And only 5 percent—keep in mind, only 5 percent of the employers were even affected by the family leave act.\\n\\nWe had a better idea. We didn\\'t win, but we had a better idea. Now we have a majority; we need to get a President. That was a tax credit to the employer. Instead of the Federal Government reaching out, we had a tax credit to pick up some of the cost, because if you have to hire a replacement worker, that\\'s a cost. This is the way it ought to work. Give more power back to the States and back to the people, back to the taxpayers, not always the long arm of the Federal Government.\\n\\nBut keep in mind this bill covers 5 percent of the employers; 95 percent of the employers and all those employees they employ are not covered in this act. And according to Investors Daily, which I read just a couple of days ago, 88 percent of the people he claims credit for were already covered in collective bargaining agreements or other agreements.\\n\\nWe had family leave in our office. I\\'m certain—I see my friend Senator Mitchell. He had family leave. I work every day with people. I spent a lot of time in hospitals. I know what it\\'s like to be in a hospital. Sure, we want family leave, but there\\'s a better way to do it.\\n\\nThe President. I only have 30 seconds. I can\\'t fix the statistics. It covers the majority of the work force. Employers of under 50 are exempted. The bill originally covered employers of 25 and more, but because of opposition, we went up to 50. Senator Dole led the opposition to it. He filibustered it. He said it was a mistake. He said it would hurt the economy. We\\'ve had record numbers of new small businesses and 10 1/2 million jobs. It didn\\'t hurt the economy. He still believes it\\'s a mistake. I believe it was right. You can decide which of us you think are right. It\\'s up to you.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Next question for Senator Dole.\\n\\nThis side. Yes, ma\\'am.\\n\\nDomestic Manufacturing\\n\\nQ. Hi. My name is Bridget Gianotti, and I\\'m a wife and mother of two sons from Carlsbad. And my question for you, Senator Dole, is as the wife of a San Diego business owner, I see one of our biggest problems is the U.S. does not manufacture enough of our own products. How would you help this problem out?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, right, we\\'ve lost 357,000 manufacturing jobs. And the Bureau of Labor Statistics said today that they made a mistake, it\\'s probably going to be a much, much higher figure. So we\\'re talking about all these new jobs, we\\'d better wait and see what the results are.\\n\\nWe\\'re going to do that with a more aggressive trade policy. We\\'re going to do that with an economic package. We\\'re going to do that with regulatory reform. You know, regulations cost the average family—right here, Democrat or Republican—about $7,000 a year—7,000. It\\'s like a tax. Put a lot of people out of business.\\n\\nI met a lady in Colorado Springs about 7 weeks ago, now. She had a small business with 63 employees. She finally gave it up. Why? Because of paperwork and regulation. Congress passed the Paperwork Reduction Act. The President exempts the IRS, which creates threefourths of the paperwork.\\n\\nWe\\'re going to have regulatory—we\\'re going to have litigation reform. You know, I fell off a platform out in California, in Chico, a while back. Before I hit the ground, my cell phone rang, and this trial lawyer says, \"I think we\\'ve got a case here.\" [Laughter] You know, we\\'ve got to stop some of these frivolous lawsuits. They\\'re putting people out of business, men and women. Get the economy going, cut the capital gains rate, create more jobs and opportunities for everybody in America—that\\'s what we will do, and my word is good. I keep my promises. I don\\'t break my promises after the election, and I don\\'t make new promises on an election year.\\n\\nWe\\'re going to get it done; we\\'re going to grow some of these jobs in America because we need to get it. They\\'re going the wrong way.\\n\\nThe President. Let\\'s look at the facts. We lost a lot of manufacturing jobs in the 12 years before I became President. We\\'ve gained manufacturing jobs since I\\'ve been President. We\\'ve negotiated over 200 separate trade agreements.\\n\\nLet\\'s just take California. In California, we made $37 billion worth of telecommunications equipment eligible for exports for the first time. We\\'re selling everything from telephones to CD\\'s to rice in Japan. We\\'re selling American automobiles in Japan now. I visited a Chrysler dealership in Japan. We\\'re number one in automobile manufacturing, production, and sales around the world again for the first time since the 1970\\'s. Why? Because we\\'ve had tough, aggressive trade policies, and because we got interest rates down, and we had a good, stable economic policy, because we\\'ve reduced the deficit 4 years in a row for the first time in the 20th century that a President\\'s done that in all 4 years.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s why I don\\'t want to see us blow a big hole in the deficit with a tax program we can\\'t pay for so your interest rates will go up and you\\'ll have to pay back in higher interest rates what you allegedly will get in a tax cut.\\n\\nSo I say keep working on expanding the markets. More than half of these 10 1/2 million new jobs were in higher wage areas, and we\\'ll have more manufacturing and more sales at home and around the world.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, you may think the biggest employer in America is General Motors, but I\\'ve got news for you. It\\'s manpower services, hiring people temporarily who\\'ve lost their jobs and they go to work for 30 days or 60 days. That\\'s a good economy? I don\\'t think so. They\\'re setting new records this year.\\n\\nWe have the worst economy in a century. We have the slowest growth, about 2.5 percent. The President inherited a growth of over 5 percent. We don\\'t have the S&L crisis anymore. Republicans have cut $53 billion in spending. That\\'s why the budget can look good. It didn\\'t look too good the first 2 years when we had a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. The next question is for President Clinton. Yes, sir?\\n\\nGay Rights\\n\\nQ. I\\'m Bob Goldfarb. I\\'m a travel agent. And can you please explain your policy on the employment nondiscrimination act that would have prohibited discrimination, would have prohibited people from being fired from their jobs simply for being gay or lesbian?\\n\\nThe President. I\\'m for it. That\\'s my policy. I\\'m for it. I believe that any law-abiding taxpaying citizen who shows up in the morning and doesn\\'t break the law and doesn\\'t interfere with his or her neighbors ought to have the ability to work in our country and shouldn\\'t be subject to unfair discrimination. I\\'m for it.\\n\\nNow, I have a little time left, so let me just say that I get attacked so many times on these questions it\\'s hard to answer all those things. In February—Senator Dole just said we had the worst economy in a century. In February he said we had the best economy in 30 years— just February. And I don\\'t want to respond in kind to all these things. I could; I could answer a lot of these things tit for tat. But I hope we can talk about what we\\'re going to do in the future. No attack ever created a job or educated a child or helped a family make ends meet. No insult ever cleaned up a toxic waste dump or helped an elderly person. Now, for 4 years that\\'s what I\\'ve worked on. If you\\'ll give me 4 years more, I\\'ll work on it some more.\\n\\nAnd I\\'ll try to answer these charges, but I prefer to emphasize direct answers to the future, and I gave you a direct answer.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Senator Dole?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, I\\'m opposed to discrimination in any form, but I\\'m—but I don\\'t favor creating special rights for any group. That would be my answer to this question. And I\\'m—you know, there\\'d be special rights for different groups in America, but I\\'m totally opposed to discrimination, don\\'t have any policy against hiring anyone—whether it\\'s lifestyle or whatever, we don\\'t have any policy of that kind, never have had in my office, nor will we have in the future.\\n\\nBut as far as special rights, I\\'m opposed to same-sex marriages, which the President signed well after midnight one morning, in the dark of night—he opposed it.\\n\\nBut I\\'ll get back to the economic package because again, I think this is very important. If there is anything that\\'s going to change America, it\\'s get the economy to grow. The President inherited a good economy—sure. The S&L crisis ended, we were selling assets, we had a Republican Congress cutting spending finally, and he says we\\'ve had the best 4 years ever. That\\'s not true. We\\'ve had over 1.2 million bankruptcies—set a new record. Credit card debt has never been higher. I just told you about this manufacturing job loss which is going to increase.\\n\\nWe need a good, strong economic package. Let the private sector create the jobs. And they can do it.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Mr. President?\\n\\nThe President. If you believe that the California economy was better in 1992 than it is today, you should vote for Bob Dole. I have worked so hard out here to help turn this economy around.\\n\\nLet me just give you one tiny example. In San Diego, where we had some defense cutbacks, we funded a project with the University of California, San Diego to use airplane composite materials to build lighter, stronger bridges—\\n\\na little project, and a program that Senator Dole opposed—and that composite now is going to be built around the bridges on the Santa Monica freeway to help minimize the impact of earthquakes and create more jobs. That\\'s just one tiny example. Maybe we\\'ll talk about some more before it\\'s over.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. The next question is for Senator Dole and it\\'s from this section.\\n\\nYes, ma\\'am? Yes?\\n\\nHealth Care\\n\\nQ. Senator Dole, I am Verda Stratigus, and I work in health care. And it\\'s truly an honor to be here tonight to address both of you.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Thank you.\\n\\nQ. Being in health care—we have talked a little bit about health care tonight, but mainly MediCal and Medicare have been mentioned, but the private sector is a problem. Managed care is taking over, especially in California, and because of that, the quality of care is going downhill. There are many, many people who cannot get the tests that they need when they need them. And because of that, they are dying needlessly. There are many, many more lawsuits being presented against the managed care industry because of this. And I think it\\'s a real problem that needs to be addressed. What would you do if you were President?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, one thing I did was to oppose the Government takeover of health care that President Clinton offered in 1993, which created 17 new taxes and 50 new bureaucracies and price controls, because we were afraid the very thing you mentioned would have happened. Everybody would have been forced into managed care. You couldn\\'t have chosen your own doctor. And that would have been the end.\\n\\nAnd I think right now we\\'ve got to go back— I know they\\'ve appointed a commission to take a look at managed care. Maybe that\\'s part of the answer. But it seems to me, if we start to take choices away from people and if we drive them into one type care, if we eliminate fee-for-service altogether or eliminate the fact you can go to your own doctor, you\\'ve got to go somewhere else, then I think we\\'ve taken a giant step backward in the United States of America.\\n\\nWe have the best health care delivery system in the world, and we want to keep it that way. That\\'s why we opposed the Government takeover health care plan that President Clinton tried and tried and tried to get through Congress.\\n\\nDidn\\'t get it done. When it ended up we had more votes than he had, then they decided to pull the plug. It was a big, big mistake. Now, whether or not he\\'ll do that again, I\\'ve heard some of the people say, \"Well, that\\'s the model we ought to use.\" And if he\\'s reelected, maybe he\\'ll come back and try it again. I hope not. I hope not in both cases. But it does seem to me that you\\'ve raised a very important point that needs to be addressed. We\\'re going to have to watch it, going to have to take a look at all the managed care going on in California, or we\\'re going to end up losing our best care that we have in the world.\\n\\nThe President. I\\'m just curious. How many of you are under managed care plans? Raise your hand if you\\'re in managed care.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Probably the young people here.\\n\\nThe President. How many of you like it? Well——\\n\\nSenator Dole. Two.\\n\\nThe President. One of the things that I tried to do was to make sure that everybody in the country who was under a managed care plan should at least have three choices of plans and would have the right to get out without penalty every year. Now, that\\'s not a Government takeover, that\\'s like the family and medical leave law. It just tries to set the rules of the game.\\n\\nI\\'m strongly in favor of a Federal bill to repeal the—any gag rules on providers. In other words, I believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need and what more expensive care options might be.\\n\\nIf we\\'re saving money and managing resources better, that\\'s a good thing. If we\\'re saving money and depriving people of care, that\\'s a bad thing. A good place to start is to say no managed care provider can gag a doctor and kick the doctor out of the managed care plan for the doctor telling the patient, \"You need a more expensive test, you need a more expensive procedure. Your health requires it.\"\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Senator Dole?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, I don\\'t have any quarrel with that. I think that would help. But I think what we want to avoid is falling back into this nationalized health care system that President Clinton wanted to give us in 1993. If that isn\\'t a liberal idea, I\\'ve never heard one: 17 new taxes; price controls; 50 new bureaucracies. We\\'d have that trouble all over America.\\n\\nWe need to deal with managed care. It not only happened in California, it\\'s happening in other States that we visit too. It\\'s a national problem, not just a State problem.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. The next question is for President Clinton, and in this section. Yes, ma\\'am. Yes.\\n\\nParticipation in Electoral Process\\n\\nQ. All right, I\\'d sort of like to—Coleen O\\'Connor. I teach history and political science at San Diego Mesa College right up the road here. And I\\'d like to tee off from the original question by another teacher and speak for those people that aren\\'t here tonight. Sixty-three percent of the American people are not participating, that are eligible to vote, not even participating in the process. Several parties can\\'t even get into the debate: the Green Party, the Reform Party, the Natural Law Party. All of these people have basically opted out of what we\\'re still participating in.\\n\\nAnd if we in fact are going to bring the country back together and be all faces around the table, the new American family, what do you see as something the President can do to begin that process to bring them back in?\\n\\nThe President. First of all, I think it\\'s important to make voting more accessible. That\\'s why I strongly supported the motor voter law. There was a big story, I think, in USA Today about the millions of people who\\'ve now registered because of it.\\n\\nSecondly, I think we need to look at making the elections more accessible. You know, several States now are letting people vote over 3 weeks. A lot of people are busy, and it\\'s hard for them to just get there and vote.\\n\\nThe third thing I think we need is more forums like this, which is one of the reasons I have so strongly supported campaign finance reform, because if you want to cut the cost of campaigns, you have to open the airwaves, because what drives the cost of a campaign are the costs of advertising on television, radio, newspaper, mass mailing. And if you open the airwaves to more things like this—you see, it\\'s not just you that are participating here. For every one of you who stood up here and asked a question tonight, I promise you, there\\'s 100,000 Americans that said, \"I wish I could have asked that question.\"\\n\\nSo I think we have to change the nature of politics. The last thing I think we should do is something I\\'ve been trying to do since I\\'ve been President, is every time I do something in a public way, I try to have a real American citizen there who is directly affected by it so that people can see the connection of what happens way across the country in Washington with more police on the street in San Diego, clean up the sewage here in San Diego, doubling the border guards here in southern California, that there is a connection between what we do way back there and what we do here.\\n\\nThose are my best ideas about it.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, I don\\'t know of any perfect solution. I\\'ve been in politics for some time, and I worry about people who don\\'t vote. And I wonder if it\\'s our fault, the candidates\\' fault. People say \"I don\\'t care. One vote doesn\\'t make a difference.\" I can give you hundreds of cases—you can probably give me 200 cases where one vote made a difference. I know it made a lot of difference many times in the Congress. Campaign finance might help, might help contributions coming in from Indonesia or other foreign countries, rich people in those countries, and then being sent back after the L.A. Times discovers it—$250,000.\\n\\nBut maybe there ought to be more debates. I\\'d be willing to have another debate this year where we\\'d invite all of the candidates and talk about the economy. If we don\\'t get the economy to grow, if we don\\'t cut taxes, and give people child credits, and cut the capital gains rate, and get this economy growing, we\\'re going to limp into the next century. If we grow the economy, it\\'s going to help Social Security, it\\'s going to help jobs, it\\'s going to help everything.\\n\\nThe President. Let me make one other suggestion. As you\\'re a teacher, you can have an impact on that.\\n\\nOne of the things I think that really frustrates people is that so often, political campaigns seem to be more about the politicians that are running than the people. Now, there is a connection, and I think what we have to do is convince people there\\'s a big difference. If you vote one way, you will have a Department of Education in the 21st century; if you vote the other way, you won\\'t. If you vote one way, you\\'ll have an expansion of family leave; if you vote the other way, you\\'ll be lucky to save it.\\n\\nBut these are important questions, and people have to decide. I think that the American people also need to be a little more responsible and think about whether there\\'s a connection in their lives and what we do in Washington.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. For Senator Dole, in this section. On the back row, yes, ma\\'am.\\n\\nSocial Security and Alternatives\\n\\nQ. I\\'m Iris Seiffert, and I\\'m unemployed.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Iris?\\n\\nQ. Iris. Senator Dole, we talked about Social Security for us baby boomers, but shouldn\\'t we be saving and investing for our own retirement as well? Are you planning any incentives to encourage us to take care of ourselves rather than to rely on the Government and on Social Security when we retire?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, we have in our economic pack individual retirement accounts where we think it\\'ll encourage savings. You could also use those accounts for health care or education or a first home. We\\'re doing that precisely. And I think one thing sooner or later we\\'re going to have to consider is to take a look at the Social Security system, because we\\'ve got a lot of people advocating that, well, we don\\'t want to put our money into Social Security. Now, you\\'ve got to be very careful about that, because you have to protect the people who are already in the pipeline. But it\\'s something you might consider. I\\'m not suggesting it will be done, but at least we ought to look at it.\\n\\nIt\\'s been looked—when I was chairman of the Finance Committee, which handles Social Security, we looked at all these options, and one thing we\\'ve got to make certain—when I used to go home, my mother would tell me, \"All I\\'ve got is my Social Security; don\\'t touch it.\" And we didn\\'t touch it. We preserved it.\\n\\nAnd I\\'m an optimist. Your Social Security is going to be there when you retire. We\\'ll fix it. It will probably happen in the year 2012 or 2015. In 1983, we thought we had a 75year fix. It didn\\'t work—much, much less. But at least we fixed it for some time, and 37 to 40 million people get their checks on time.\\n\\nSo we need to preserve the system, and we need to make it stronger. But we also need to look at some options whether or not we— it would depend on what the options are. In fact, they\\'ve got a commission right now in Congress, a bipartisan commission, looking at all the different options they\\'re going to present to the next Congress. So I think we\\'ll wait and see what they present, take a look at it.\\n\\nThe President. This is one where we have some agreement, I think. Only about half the people in this country have pension plans, and Social Security is not enough for a lot of people to live on, or at least it\\'s not enough for them to maintain anything like their previous lifestyle. So we\\'ve got to figure out how we\\'re going to have more people with pension plans. And pension coverage has been declining as more and more people work for small businesses and fewer people work for big businesses.\\n\\nSo what is in my plan—and I think it\\'s almost identical to what\\'s in Senator Dole\\'s plan—is we make more people than are now eligible to save in an IRA, and we\\'d let couples—married couples save more, and then they could withdraw from it tax-free if they needed to for medical emergencies or to buy a home or for an education, but they could also save to supplement their retirement.\\n\\nIn addition to that, we just passed a sweeping small business reform that makes it easier for small-business people to take out 401(k) plans for themselves and their employees and then much easier for employees to carry it from job to job. My best friend from grade school is a computer software salesman, and he told me last time he changed employers it took him 9 months to figure out how to transfer his 401(k) plan. Now, none of that will happen anymore. And so I hope that over the next 10 years you\\'ll see a big increase in the percentage of people that have pension plans plus a secure Social Security System.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Did you say you\\'re unemployed? The first thing we ought to do is get you a job. And that\\'s the economic package again: Create jobs and opportunities, reduce the capital gains rate, reduce regulatory reform, stop some of this senseless litigation, and let people work in America. And I think that\\'s the thrust we will make.\\n\\nObviously, Social Security is a very important program. It\\'ll be preserved—Democrats or Republicans. It\\'ll be preserved. We want to make certain we protect those in the pipeline, just as we did back in 1983. And we did it on a bipartisan basis. We took it out of politics. People get so tired of politics. And we ought to do the same with Medicare. Maybe we could make a deal here tonight.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. All right, the question is for President Clinton. Does anybody have a foreign affairs question in this section? Yes, sir.\\n\\nTrade With Japan\\n\\nQ. Good evening. I\\'m Michael Smith. I\\'m an electronics technician in the Navy. My question was how you plan to deal with the trade deficit with Japan?\\n\\nThe President. Let me tell you what we have done. We have concluded with Japan 21, about to be 22 trade agreements now. And since we did that, in the areas where we concluded trade agreements, our exports to Japan have gone up by 85 percent in the last 4 years, and our trade deficit with Japan has gone down. Until about 5 months ago, the Japanese economy was in a deep recession. It\\'s coming back now, so they can buy even more American products, and I think it\\'ll go down more.\\n\\nBut I\\'m very—that\\'s one of the real success stories here of the work we\\'ve done. We\\'re selling Japanese rice from California for the first time. I visited a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo. I visited a Jeep plant, the oldest auto plant in America, in Toledo, Ohio, where they\\'re going to export 41,000 right-hand-drive Jeeps this year, and they\\'ve got 700 new jobs because of it.\\n\\nThere is no easy way to do this. When you\\'re dealing with an economy that\\'s traditionally been more closed and one that\\'s traditionally been more open, you just have to gut it out issue by issue by issue. We agreed in principle on our insurance agreement, and we\\'re working on three or four other areas now. But the way you have to do it is make sure you\\'re competitive—we\\'re the most competitive country in the world now—and then just fight to open those markets and go try to make the sale. And that\\'s what our trade ambassador, our Commerce Secretary, and all the other people in our administration have tried to do.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Senator?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, the bottom line is we\\'ve got to stop exporting jobs. We need to keep jobs here. I said there are 357,000 good jobs, manufacturing jobs, which were lost. And I assume some of those because of our trading partners; we didn\\'t have access to their markets. We ought to insist on access. If we don\\'t have access to their markets the same way they have access to our markets, we ought to say, \"Wait, that\\'s enough. Time out. When you give us access, we\\'ll give you access.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s very hard to get into the Japanese market, as everybody knows. They want to get into our market. They sell a lot of automobiles here, create a lot of jobs—those who sell exports. And it\\'s very important to the economy. But I think we want to make certain.\\n\\nI supported the President\\'s trade policy, but we\\'ve got to be more aggressive. Once you have a policy, then you\\'ve got to go out and be aggressive and enforce that policy. There are American jobs that are being lost. This is what Ross Perot complains about. And I\\'d say to the Reform Party, take a look at the Republican Party. We\\'re the reform party, and we\\'re going to make things better. And one of the things we\\'re going to do is stop exporting jobs in America.\\n\\nThe President. Let me say again, we\\'ve had over 200 separate trade agreements in the last 4 years, by far the largest number in American history, not just the big ones you\\'ve read about but a lot of smaller ones. And now what we have to do is to focus on those things we\\'re real good at and make sure we\\'re getting a fair deal.\\n\\nWe just had a pretty serious dispute with China because they were copying our CD\\'s and costing thousands of jobs in places like California. But we said, \"You know, if you want to keep doing business and selling your products over here, you\\'re going to have to quit pirating our CD\\'s.\" And they agreed to do a number of things and to let us verify that they\\'d done it. But I think they\\'re going to make the problem much better.\\n\\nBut there is not a simple, easy answer. You just have to work on this day-in and day-out, every month, every year, every issue to make sure that we have not only free trade but fair trade. I\\'m proud that we\\'re better off on that than we were 4 years ago.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. All right, the next question is for Senator Dole, and it\\'s in this section. Yes, sir.\\n\\nReligion and Values\\n\\nQ. Ron Kite, minister.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Hi, Ron.\\n\\nQ. This great Nation has been established by the Founding Fathers, who possessed very strong Christian beliefs and godly principles. If elected President of the United States, what could you do to return this Nation to these basic principles? And also, do you feel that the office of the President has the responsibility to set the role example to inspire our young people?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, no doubt about it, our Founding Fathers had a great deal of wisdom. And in addition to what you mentioned, they also were concerned about this all-powerful central Government in Washington, DC, that would in effect confiscate your property. So I carry around in my pocket—I can\\'t pull it out, I\\'d violate the rules—a copy of the 10th amendment, which says that we ought to return power to the States and power to the people—people here. You ought to make more decisions.\\n\\nHonor, duty, and country: that\\'s what America is all about. Certainly the President of the United States, in the highest office in the world, the most important office in the world, has a responsibility to young people, as we talked about earlier—to everyone, by example. And when it comes to public ethics, he has a responsibility. When you have 30-some in your administration who\\'ve either left or are being investigated or in jail or whatever, then you\\'ve got an ethical problem. It\\'s public ethics—I\\'m not talking about private, we\\'re talking about public ethics—when you have 900 files gathered up by some guy who was a bouncer in a bar and hired as a security officer to collect files. In Watergate, I know a person who went to jail for looking at one file, one FBI file. There are 900 sequestered in the White House—900— people like you. Why should they be rifling through your files?\\n\\nSo the President has a great responsibility. And it\\'s one that I understand and would certainly carry out.\\n\\nThe President. This is the most religious great country in history, and yet, interestingly enough, we have the most religious freedom of any country in the world, including the freedom not to believe. And now we have all these people— just up the road in Los Angeles County we\\'ve got people from 150 different racial and ethnic groups, and they\\'ve got tons of different religions. But the fundamental tenets of virtually every religion are the same. And what I\\'ve tried to do is to support policies that would respect religion, and then help parents inculcate those values to their children. Let me very briefly give you some examples.\\n\\nOne of my proudest moments was signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which says the Government\\'s got to bend over backwards before we interfere with religious practice. So I changed a Justice Department effort to get a church to pay back a man\\'s tithe because he was bankrupt when he gave it.\\n\\nI\\'ve supported character education programs in our schools, drug-free schools programs. I\\'ve supported giving parents a V-chip on their television so if they don\\'t want their young kids to watch things they shouldn\\'t watch, they wouldn\\'t have to. That\\'s the kind of thing we need to do, give people like you and our families the power to give those values to our children.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, I think it\\'s—you know, before I came in tonight, my wife and daughter and I had a prayer because if it\\'s God\\'s will, whatever happens—if it\\'s God\\'s will, it will happen.\\n\\nA constitutional amendment for voluntary prayer in school in my view would be a great idea. I support it, and the President opposes it. I mean, it seems to me the President, whoever the President may be, this is one of his highest responsibilities. People look to the President of the United States more than any other person in America. And that\\'s the way it\\'s always been, and that\\'s the way it always will be.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. All right, this is our last question. It goes to President Clinton, and it\\'s from this section.\\n\\nYes, ma\\'am?\\n\\n\"Special Rights\"\\n\\nQ. My name is Evette Duby, and I too am a minister; I\\'m with the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches.\\n\\nPresident Clinton, perhaps you can help me with something tonight. I\\'ve heard Mr. Dole say several times, \"all of us together.\" And when he was asked if he would support equal rights in employment for gay and lesbian people, you said that you favored that, and he said that he did not believe in special rights. And I thought the question was equal rights for all people, and I don\\'t understand why people are using the term \"special rights\" when the question is equal rights. Could you help me in understanding that?\\n\\nThe President. I want to answer your question, but let me say one other thing. We don\\'t need a constitutional amendment for kids to pray. And what I did was to have the Justice Department and the Education Department, for the first time ever, issue a set of guidelines that we gave to every school in America saying that children could not be interfered with in religious advocacy, when they were praying, when they were doing whatever they could do under the Constitution just because they were on a public school grounds. And I think anyone who has experienced this would tell you that our administration has done more than any in 30 years to clarify the freedom of religion in the public square, including in the public schools.\\n\\nNow, I think I have to let Senator Dole speak for himself. It wouldn\\'t be fair for me to do that. I would wind up—I mean, it\\'s the last question, and I\\'d mischaracterize it to try to make you happy.\\n\\nLet me tell you what I feel. We have a lot of differences in our country, and some of us believe that other people\\'s decisions are wrong, even immoral. But under our Constitution, if you show up tomorrow and obey the law, and you work hard, and you do what you are supposed to do, you\\'re entitled to equal treatment. That\\'s the way the system works.\\n\\nAll over the world, people are being torn apart—Bosnia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Burundi, you name it—because of all their differences. We still have some of that hatred inside us; you see it in the church burnings. And one of the things I\\'ve tried hardest to do is to tell the American people that we have to get beyond that, we have to understand that we\\'re stronger when we unite around shared values instead of being divided by our differences.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Senator Dole?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, I hope I made my answer clear. I said I\\'m opposed to discrimination. You know, we\\'ve suffered discrimination in the disability community. There are 43 million of us. And I can recall cases where people would cross the street rather than meet somebody in a wheelchair.\\n\\nSo we want to end discrimination. I think that answers itself. No discrimination in America. We\\'ve made that clear. And I would just say that it seems to me that that\\'s the way it ought to be. We shouldn\\'t discriminate—race, color, whatever, lifestyle, disability. This is America, and we\\'re all proud of it. But we\\'re not there yet. What we need is good, strong leadership going into the next century.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry we didn\\'t have a foreign policy question, because just this week Secretary Christopher said, \"Well, we really didn\\'t know much the first couple of years about foreign policy.\" Now, that was quite an admission. It underscores what I had to say in the Hartford debate, that there is really no foreign policy in this administration. It\\'s sort of ad hoc: \"Whatever comes up, we\\'ll deal with it.\" Unfortunately, we didn\\'t have more questions on that.\\n\\nThe President. Let me say again, there is no more important responsibility for the President than to say, \"If you believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, that\\'s all we need to know. And you can be part of our America, and you can walk across that bridge to the 21st century with us.\"\\n\\nAnd we are not well served when we attack each other in a kind of an ad hominem way. It doesn\\'t create jobs. It doesn\\'t educate children. It doesn\\'t solve problems. We need to be disagreeing on ideas honestly and talking about the future. The future will be the greatest time in this country\\'s history if we can beat this division that is bedeviling the whole rest of the world.\\n\\nClosing Statements\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. All right. Now we go to the closing statements. Senator Dole, you\\'re first. Two minutes, sir.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, let me thank everybody here at the university, and Jim, thank you, all the people who may still be watching or viewing. This is what it\\'s all about. It\\'s not about me. It\\'s not about President Clinton. It\\'s about the process. It\\'s about selecting a President of the United States.\\n\\nSo we have our differences. We should have our differences. I mentioned other parties. They have their differences. If we all agreed, it\\'d be a pretty dull place. We should have more debates. Maybe we\\'ll have another debate on the economy.\\n\\nBut I would just say this: This is the highest honor that I have ever had in my life, to think that somebody from Russell, Kansas, somebody who grew up living in a basement apartment, somebody whose parents didn\\'t finish high school, somebody who spent about 39 months in hospitals after World War II, somebody who uses a buttonhook every day to get dressed, somebody who understands that there are real Americans out there with real problems, whether soccer moms or the single parents or families working or seniors or people with disabilities, whoever it may be.\\n\\nBut there are some very fundamental differences in this campaign. President Clinton opposes term limits. President Clinton opposes a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. President Clinton opposes a voluntary prayer amendment. He opposes an amendment to protect the flag of the United States of America. People give their lives—a couple of servicemen here—they sacrifice, they give everything for America. We ought to protect the American flag with a constitutional amendment.\\n\\nBut beyond that, we need to address the economy. And I would just say, with my time running out here, it\\'s a very proud moment for me. And what I want the voters to do is to make a decision. And I want them to be proud of their vote in the years ahead, proud that they voted for the right candidate, proud that they voted, hopefully, for me.\\n\\nAnd I\\'ll just make you one promise. My word is good. Democrats and Republicans have said Bob Dole\\'s word is good. I keep my word. I promise you, the economy is going to get better, we\\'re going to have a good economic package, and we\\'re going into the next century a better America.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Mr. President.\\n\\nThe President. Thank you, Jim. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and all the people who are watching.\\n\\nOne thing I\\'d like to say is I agree with what Senator Dole said. It\\'s a remarkable thing in a country like ours that a man who grew up in Russell, Kansas, and one who was born to a widowed mother in Hope, Arkansas, could wind up running for President, could have a chance to serve as President. So the first thing I want to say is thank you for giving me the chance to be President.\\n\\nThis election is about two different visions about how we should go into the 21st century. Would we be better off—as I believe—working together to give each other the tools we need to make the most of our God-given potential, or are we better off saying, \"You\\'re on your own\"? Would we be better off building that bridge to the future together so we can all walk across it, or saying, \"You can get across yourself\"?\\n\\nIf you don\\'t leave this room with anything else tonight and if the people watching us don\\'t leave with anything else, I hope you\\'ll leave with this: This is a real important election. The world is changing dramatically in how we work and how we live, how we relate to each other— huge changes. And the decisions we make will have enormous practical consequences.\\n\\nSo we\\'ve talked about our responsibilities tonight. I want to talk about your responsibility and your responsibility. Your responsibility is to show up on November 5th, because you\\'re going to decide whether we\\'re going to balance the budget now but protect Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment. You\\'ll decide whether we\\'re going to keep fighting crime with the Brady bill, the assault weapons, and finish putting those 100,000 police; whether we\\'re going to move a million people from welfare to work; whether we\\'re going to give our families more protection for their kids against drugs and tobacco and gangs and guns; whether we\\'re going to give our children world-class education where every 8-year-old can read, every 12-yearold can log in on the Internet, every 18-yearold can go to college.\\n\\nIf we do those things, we\\'ll build that bridge to the 21st century, and the greatest country in history will be even greater.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nThis concludes—this is the last of the three 1996 Presidential and Vice Presidential debates.'}, {'file': '80_debate_1', 'content': 'MRS. HINERFELD. Good evening.\\n\\nI\\'m Ruth Hinerfeld of the League of Women Voters Education Fund. Next Tuesday is election day. Before going to the polls, voters want to understand the issues and know the candidates\\' positions. Tonight, voters will have an opportunity to see and hear the major party candidates for the Presidency state their views on issues that affect us all. The League of Women Voters is proud to present this Presidential debate.\\n\\nOur moderator is Howard K. Smith.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Thank you, Mrs. Hinerfeld.\\n\\nThe League of Women Voters is pleased to welcome to the Cleveland, Ohio, Convention Center Music Hall President Jimmy Carter, the Democratic Party\\'s candidate for reelection to the Presidency, and Governor Ronald Reagan of California, the Republican Party\\'s candidate for the Presidency. The candidates will debate questions on domestic, economic, foreign policy, and national security issues.\\n\\nThe questions are going to be posed by a panel of distinguished journalists who are here with me. They are: Marvin Stone, the editor of U.S. News and World Report; Harry Ellis, national correspondent of the Christian Science Monitor; William Hilliard, assistant managing editor of the Portland Oregonian; Barbara Walters, correspondent, ABC News.\\n\\nThe ground rules for this, as agreed by you gentlemen, are these: Each panelist down here will ask a question, the same question, to each of the two candidates. After the two candidates have answered, a panelist will ask followup questions to try to sharpen the answers. The candidates will then have an opportunity each to make a rebuttal. That will constitute the first half of the debate, and I will state the rules for the second half later on.\\n\\nSome other rules: The candidates are not permitted to bring prepared notes to the podium, but are permitted to make notes during the debate. If the candidates exceed the allotted time agreed on, I will reluctantly but certainly interrupt. We ask the Convention Center audience here to abide by one ground rule: Please do not applaud or express approval or disapproval during the debate.\\n\\nNow, based on a toss of the coin, Governor Reagan will respond to the first question from Marvin Stone.\\n\\nQUESTIONS\\n\\nU.S. ARMED FORCES\\n\\nMR. STONE. Governor, as you\\'re well aware, the question of war and peace has emerged as a central issue in this campaign in the give-and-take of recent weeks. President Carter\\'s been criticized for responding late to aggressive Soviet impulses, for insufficient buildup of our Armed Forces, and a paralysis in dealing with Afghanistan and Iran. You have been criticized for being all too quick to advocate the use of lots of muscle, military action, to deal with foreign crises. Specifically, what are the differences between the two of you on the uses of American military power?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. I don\\'t know what the differences might be, because I don\\'t know what Mr. Carter\\'s policies are. I do know what he has said about mine. And I\\'m only here to tell you that I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace, and that use of force is always and only a last resort, when everything else has failed, and then only with regard to our national security.\\n\\nNow, I believe, also that this meeting, this mission, this responsibility for preserving the peace, which I believe is a responsibility peculiar to our country, that we cannot shirk our responsibility as the leader of the Free World, because we\\'re the only one that can do it. And therefore, the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us. And to maintain that peace requires strength. America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong. We can get into a war by letting events get out of hand, as they have in the last 3Â¼ years under the foreign policies of this administration of Mr. Carter\\'s, until we\\'re faced each time with a crisis. And good management in preserving the peace requires that we control the events and try to intercept before they become a crisis.\\n\\nBut I have seen four wars in my lifetime. I\\'m a father of sons; I have a grandson. I don\\'t ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into sandy beachheads in the Pacific, or rice paddies and jungles in Asia, or the muddy, bloody battlefields of Europe.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Mr. Stone, do you have a followup question for the Governor?\\n\\nMR. STONE. Yes. Governor, we\\'ve been hearing that the defense buildup that you would associate yourself with would cost tens of billions of dollars more than is now contemplated. In assuming that the American people are ready to bear this cost, they nevertheless keep asking the following question: How do you reconcile huge increases in military outlays with your promise of substantial tax cuts and of balancing the budget, which in this fiscal year, the one that just ended, ran more than $60 billion in the red?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Mr. Stone, I have submitted an economic plan that I\\'ve worked out in concert with a number of fine economists in this country, all of whom approve it, and believe that over a 5-year projection, this plan can permit the extra spending for needed refurbishing of our defensive posture, that it can provide for a balanced budget by 1983, if not earlier, and that we can afford-along with the cuts that I have proposed in Government spending — we can afford the tax cuts I have proposed — and probably, mainly because Mr. Carter\\'s economic policy has built into the next 5 years, and on beyond that, a tax increase that will be taking $86 billion more next year out of the people\\'s pockets than was taken this year. And my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that $86 billion increase. I\\'m only reducing the amount of the increase.\\n\\nIn other words, what I\\'m talking about is not putting Government back to getting less money than Government\\'s been getting, but simply cutting the increase in spending.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. The same question now goes to President Garter. President Carter, would you like to have the question repeated?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Yes.\\n\\nMR. STONE. Yes, President Carter, the question of war and peace, a central issue in this campaign. You\\'ve been criticized in the give-and-take for responding late to aggressive Soviet impulses, for an insufficient buildup of our Armed Forces, and a paralysis in dealing with Afghanistan and Iran. Governor Reagan, on the other hand, has been criticized for being all too quick to advocate the use of lots of muscle, military action, to deal with foreign crises such as I mentioned. Specifically, what are the differences between the two of you on the uses of American military power?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Mr. Stone, I\\'ve had to make thousands of decisions since I\\'ve been President, serving in the Oval Office. And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process. I think I\\'m a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated 4 years ago against President Ford. I\\'ve also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions. H. L. Mencken said that for every problem there\\'s a simple answer. It would be neat and plausible — and wrong.\\n\\nThe fact is that this Nation, in the 8 years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased. Seven out of eight years, the budget commitments for defense went down, 37 percent, in all. Since I\\'ve been in office, we\\'ve had a steady, carefully planned, methodical but very effective increase in our commitment for defense.\\n\\nBut what we\\'ve done is to use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace. We\\'ve not only kept peace for our own country, but we\\'ve been able to extend the benefits of peace to others. In the Middle East, we\\'ve worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, successfully, and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability. This is a very good step forward for our Nation\\'s security, and we\\'ll continue to do as we\\'ve done in the past.\\n\\nI might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature. There are always troublespots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President, alone in that Oval Office, affects our Nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests. That is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently by every President who serves. That\\'s what I\\'ve tried to do, successfully, by keeping our country at peace.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Mr. Stone, do you have a followup on —\\n\\nMR. STONE. Yes. I would like to be a little more specific on the use of military power, and let\\'s talk about one area for a moment.\\n\\nUnder what circumstances would you use military forces to deal with, for example, a shutoff of Persian Oil Gulf, if that should occur, or to counter Russian expansion beyond Afghanistan into either Iran or Pakistan? I ask this question in view of charges that we are woefully unprepared to project sustained — and I emphasize the word \"sustained\" — power in that part of the world.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Mr. Stone, in my State of the Union address earlier this year, I pointed out that any threat to the stability or security of the Persian Gulf would be a threat to the security of our own country. In the past, we\\'ve not had an adequate military presence in that region. Now we have two major carrier task forces. We have access to facilities in five different areas of that region. And we\\'ve made it clear that working with our allies and others, that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world.\\n\\nBut in doing this, we have made sure that we address this question peacefully, not injecting American military forces into combat, but letting the strength of our Nation be felt in a beneficial way. This, I believe, has assured that our interests will be protected in the Persian Gulf region, as we\\'ve done in the Middle East and throughout the world.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan, you have a minute to comment or rebut.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Well, yes, I question the figure about the decline in defense spending under the two previous administrations, in the preceding 8 years to this administration. I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those 8 years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace. I also would like to point out that Republican Presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both Houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut.\\n\\nNow, Gerald Ford left a 5-year projected plan for a military buildup to restore our defenses, and President Garter\\'s administration reduced that by 38 percent, cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program that had been proposed, and stopped the B-1, delayed the cruise missile, stopped the production line for the Minuteman missiles, delayed the Trident submarine, and now is planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots in the world — which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one that is quick to look for use of force.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. President Carter, you have the last word on this question.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Well, there are various elements of defense. One is to control nuclear weapons, which I hope we\\'ll get to later on, because that\\'s the most important single issue in this campaign. Another one is how to address troubled areas of the world. I think, habitually, Governor Reagan has advocated the injection of military forces into troubled areas, when I and my predecessors both Democrats and Republicans — have advocated resolving those troubles and those difficult areas of the world peacefully, diplomatically, and through negotiation.\\n\\nIn addition to that, the buildup of military forces is good for our country, because we\\'ve got to have military strength in order to preserve the peace. But I\\'ll always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat, and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle. Strength is imperative for peace, but the two must go hand in hand.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Thank you, gentlemen. The next question is from Harry Ellis to President Carter.\\n\\nTHE NATION\\'S ECONOMY\\n\\nMR. ELLIS. Mr. President, when you were elected in 1976, the Consumer Price Index stood at 4.8 percent. It now stands at more than 12 percent. Perhaps more significantly, the Nation\\'s broader, underlying inflation rate has gone up from 7 to 9 percent. Now, a part of that was due to external factors beyond U.S. control, notably the more than doubling of oil prices by OPEC last year.\\n\\nBecause the United States remains vulnerable to such external shocks, can inflation in fact be controlled? If so, what measures would you pursue in a second term?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Again it\\'s important to put the situation into perspective. In 1974 we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree. We had an even worse oil shock in 1979. In 1974 we had the worst recession, the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War. The recession that resulted this time was the briefest we\\'ve had since the Second World War.\\n\\nIn addition, we\\'ve brought down inflation. Earlier this year, the first quarter, we did have a very severe inflation pressure, brought about by the OPEC price increase. It averaged about 18 percent the first quarter of this year. The second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13 percent. The most recent figures, the last 3 months, or the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7 percent — still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs — 9 million new jobs in the last 3 1/2 years — that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us.\\n\\nI noticed that Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30-percent inflation rate. And Business Week, which is not a Democratic publication, said that this Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal — and I quote them, I think-was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this Nation.\\n\\nSo, our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature. So, to add 9 million new jobs, to control inflation, and to plan for the future with the energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Mr. Ellis, do you have a followup question for Mr. Carter?\\n\\nMR. ELLIS. Yes, Mr. President. You have mentioned the creation of 9 million new jobs.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Yes.\\n\\nMR. ELLIS. At the same time, the unemployment rate still hangs high, as does the inflation rate. Now, I wonder, can you tell us what additional policies you would pursue in a second administration in order to try to bring down that inflation rate? And would it be an act of leadership to tell the American people they\\'re going to have to sacrifice to adopt a leaner lifestyle for some time to come?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Yes. We have demanded that the American people sacrifice, and they\\'ve done very well. As a matter of fact, we\\'re importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago. We\\'ve had a 25-percent reduction since the first year I was in office. At the same time, as I said earlier, we have added about 9 million net new jobs in that period of time — a record never before achieved.\\n\\nAlso, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One, conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well — more coal this year than ever before in history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history.\\n\\nThe new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs — about a million in the next 2 years. And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people. This has already passed the House; now has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Now, the same question goes to Governor Reagan. Governor Reagan, would you like to have the question repeated?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes, please.\\n\\nMR. ELLIS. Governor Reagan, during the past 4 years, the Consumer Price Index has risen from 4.8 percent to currently over 12 percent. And perhaps more significantly, the Nation\\'s broader, underlying rate of inflation has gone up from 7 to 9 percent. Now, a part of that has been due to external factors beyond U.S. control, and notably, the more than doubling of OPEC oil prices last year, which leads me to ask you whether, since the United States remains vulnerable to such external shocks, can inflation in fact be controlled? If so, specifically what measures would you pursue?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country, that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it\\'s uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious, and it\\'s dangerous to say this to the people. When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4.8 percent, as you said. It had been cut in two by President Gerald Ford. It is now running at 12.7 percent.\\n\\nPresident Carter also has spoken of the new jobs created. Well, we always, with the normal growth in our country and increase in population, increase the number of jobs. But that can\\'t hide the fact that there are 8 million men and women out of work in America today, and 2 million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months. Mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation. And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18 percent.\\n\\nSince then, he has blamed to the people for inflation, OPEC, he\\'s blamed the Federal Reserve System, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less. We don\\'t have inflation because the people are living too well. We have inflation because the Government is living too well.\\n\\nAnd the last statement, just a few days ago, was a speech to the effect that we have inflation because Government revenues have not kept pace with Government spending. I see my time is running out here. I\\'ll have to get this down very fast.\\n\\nYes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of Government to the place that we have balanced budgets and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in. And my economic plan calls for that.\\n\\nThe President\\'s economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way. But we\\'ll have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. A followup, Mr. Ellis?\\n\\nMR. ELLIS. Yes, you have centered on cutting Government spending in what you have just said about your own policies. You have also said that you would increase defense spending. Specifically, where would you cut Government spending if you were to increase defense spending and also cut taxes, so that, presumably, Federal revenues would shrink?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Well, most people, when they think about cutting Government spending, they think in terms of eliminating necessary programs or wiping out something, some service that Government is supposed to perform. I believe that there is enough extravagance and fat in Government. As a matter of fact, one of the Secretaries of HEW under Mr. Carter testified that he thought there was $7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it. We\\'ve had the General Accounting Office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone, and they have added that waste adds even more to that.\\n\\nWe have a program for a gradual reduction of Government spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made. I\\'m confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation, because I did it in California. And inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned money to the people and reduced government spending.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. President Carter.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Governor Reagan\\'s proposal, the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, is one of the most highly inflationary ideas that ever has been presented to the American public. He would actually have to cut Government spending by at least $130 billion in order to balance the budget under this ridiculous proposal.\\n\\nI noticed that his task force that\\'s working for his future plans had some of their ideas revealed in the Wall Street Journal this week. One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year, Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage. This is a heartless kind of approach to the working families of our country which is typical of many Republican leaders in the past, but I think has been accentuated under Governor Reagan.\\n\\nIn California — I\\'m surprised Governor Reagan brought this up — he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that State under his administration. He more than doubled State spending while he was Governor — 122-percent increase — and had between a 20- and 30-percent increase in the number of employees —\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Sorry to interrupt —\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. — in California.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. — Mr. Carter.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Thank you, sir.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan has the last word on this question.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes. The figures that the President has just used about California is a distortion of the situation there, because while I was Governor of California, our spending in California increased less per capita than the spending in Georgia while Mr. Carter was Governor of Georgia in the same 4 years. The size of government increased only onesixth in California of what it increased in proportion to population in Georgia.\\n\\nAnd the idea that my tax-cut proposal is inflationary: I would like to ask the President, why is it inflationary to let the people keep more of their money and spend it the way they\\'d like, and it isn\\'t inflationary to let him take that money and spend it the way he wants?\\n\\nMR. SMITH. I wish that question need not be rhetorical, but it must be because we\\'ve run out of time on that. [Laughter] Now, the third question to Governor Reagan from William Hilliard.\\n\\nURBAN POLICIES\\n\\nMR. HILLIARD. Yes, Governor Reagan, the decline of our cities has been hastened by the continual rise in crime, strained race relations, the fall in the quality of public education, the persistence of abnormal poverty in a rich nation, and a decline in the services to the public. The signs seem to point toward a deterioration that could lead to the establishment of a permanent underclass in the cities. What, specifically, would you do in the next 4 years to reverse this trend?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. I have been talking to a number of Congressmen who have much the same idea that I have, and that is that in the inner-city areas, that in cooperation with local government and with National Government, and using tax incentives and with cooperation with the private sector, that we have development zones. Let the local entity, the city, declare this particular area, based on the standards of the percentage of people on welfare, unemployed, and so forth, in that area. And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas.\\n\\nThe elements of government through these tax incentives for example, a business that would not have, for a period of time, an increase in the property tax reflecting its development of the unused property that it was making wouldn\\'t be any loss to the city, because the city isn\\'t getting any tax from that now. And there would simply be a delay, and on the other hand, many of the people that would then be given jobs are presently wards of the Government, and it wouldn\\'t hurt to give them a tax incentive, because that wouldn\\'t be costing Government anything either.\\n\\nI think there are things to do in this regard. I stood in the South Bronx on the exact spot that President Carter stood on in 1977. You have to see it to believe it. It looks like a bombed-out city — great, gaunt skeletons of buildings, windows smashed out, painted on one of them \"Unkept promises,\" on another, \"Despair.\" And this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was going to bring in a vast program to rebuild this area. There are whole blocks of land that are left bare, just bulldozed down flat, and nothing has been done. And they are now charging to take tourists through there to see this terrible desolation.\\n\\nI talked to a man just briefly there who asked me one simple question: \"Do I have reason to hope that I can someday take care of my family again? Nothing has been done.\"\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Follow-up, Mr. Hilliard?\\n\\nMR. HILLIARD. Yes, Governor Reagan. Blacks and other nonwhites are increasing in numbers in our cities. Many of them feel that they are facing a hostility from whites that prevents them from joining the economic mainstream of our society. There is racial confrontation in the schools, on jobs, and in housing, as nonwhites seek to reap the benefits of a free society. What do you think is the Nation\\'s future as a multiracial society?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. I believe in it. I am eternally optimistic, and I happen to believe that we\\'ve made great progress from the days when I was young and when this country didn\\'t even know it had a racial problem. I know those things can grow out of despair in an inner city, when there\\'s hopelessness at home, lack of work, and so forth. But I believe that all of us together — and I believe the Presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was; it\\'s a bully pulpit — and I think that something can be done from there, because the goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us — ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be — that we will have total equal opportunity for all people. And I would do everything I could in my power to bring that about.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Mr. Hilliard, would you repeat your question for President Carter?\\n\\nMR. HILLIARD. President Carter, the decline of our cities has been hastened by the continual rise in crime, strained race relations, the fall in the quality of public education, the persistence of abnormal poverty in a rich nation, and a decline in services to the public. The signs seem to point toward a deterioration that could lead to the establishment of a permanent underclass in the cities. What, specifically, would you do in the next 4 years to reverse this trend?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Thank you, Mr. Hilliard.\\n\\nWhen I was campaigning in 1976, everywhere I went the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our Nation. We initiated a very fine urban renewal program, working with the mayors, the Governors, and other interested officials. This has been a very successful effort. That\\'s one of the main reasons that we\\'ve had such an increase in the number of people employed. Of the 9 million people put to work in new jobs since I\\'ve been in office, 1.3 million of those has been among black Americans and another million among those who speak Spanish.\\n\\nWe now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit. Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country. We also are pursuing housing programs. We\\'ve had a 73-percent increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education. These are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders, particularly in the minority areas of the central cities that had been deteriorating so rapidly in the past.\\n\\nIt\\'s very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens. I\\'ve brought into the top levels of Government — into the White House, into administrative offices of the executive branch, into the judicial system — highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded.\\n\\nI noticed that Governor Reagan said that when he was a younger man that there was no knowledge of a racial problem in this country. Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem. We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. A followup question?\\n\\nMR. HILLIARD. Yes, President Carter, I\\'d like to repeat the same followup to you. Blacks and other nonwhites are increasing in numbers in our cities. Many of them feel that they are facing a hostility from whites that prevents them from joining the economic mainstream of our society. There is racial confrontation in the schools, on jobs, and in housing, as nonwhites seek to reap the benefits of a free society. What is your assessment of the Nation\\'s future in a multiracial society?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Ours is a nation of refugees, a nation of immigrants. Almost all of our citizens came here from other lands and now have hopes, which are being realized, for a better life, preserving their ethnic commitments, their family structures, their religious beliefs, preserving their relationships with their relatives in foreign countries, but still forming themselves together in a very coherent society, which gives our Nation its strength.\\n\\nIn the past, those minority groups have often been excluded from participation in the affairs of government. Since I\\'ve been President, I\\'ve appointed, for instance, more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous Presidents in the history of this country. I\\'ve done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans. To involve them in administration of government and a feeling that they belong to the societal structure that makes decisions in the judiciary and in executive branch is a very important commitment which I am trying to realize and will continue to do so in the future.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan, you have a minute for rebuttal.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes. The President talks of Government programs, and they have their place. But as Governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end. They were public employment for these people who really want to get out into the private job market, where there are jobs with a future.\\n\\nNow, the President spoke a moment ago about — that I was against the minimum wage. I wish he could have been with me when I sat with a group of teenagers who were black and who were telling me about their unemployment problems, and that it was the minimum wage that had done away with the jobs that they once could get. And indeed, every time it has increased you will find there is an increase in minority unemployment among young people. And therefore, I have been in favor of a separate minimum for them.\\n\\nWith regard to the great progress that has been made with this Government spending, the rate of black unemployment in Detroit, Michigan, is 56 percent.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. President Garter, you have the last word on this question.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Well, it\\'s obvious that we still have a long way to go in fully incorporating the minority groups into the mainstream of American life. We have made good progress, and there\\'s no doubt in my mind that the commitment to unemployment compensation, the minimum wage, welfare, national health insurance, those kinds of commitments that have typified the Democratic Party since ancient history in this country\\'s political life are a very important element of the future. In all those elements, Governor Reagan has repeatedly spoken out against them, which, to me, shows a very great insensitivity to giving deprived families a better chance in life. This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly.\\n\\nThere is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown, central cities, with the new commitment on an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel-efficient, with a chance for a synthetic fuels program, solar power, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Thank you, gentlemen.\\n\\nNow for the fourth question, to President Garter from Barbara Walters.\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL TERRORISM\\n\\nMS. WALTERS. Mr. President, the eyes of the country tonight are on the hostages in Iran. I realize this is a sensitive area, but the question of how we respond to acts of terrorism goes beyond this current crisis. Other countries have policies that determine how they will respond. Israel, for example, considers hostages like soldiers and will not negotiate with terrorists.\\n\\nFor the future, Mr. President, the country has the right to know, do you have a policy for dealing with terrorism wherever it might happen, and what have we learned from this experience in Iran that might cause us to do things differently if this or something similar happens again?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Barbara, one of the blights on this world is the threat and the activities of terrorists. At one of the recent economic summit conferences between myself and the other leaders of the We. stern world, we committed ourselves to take strong action against terrorism. Airplane hijacking was one of the elements of that commitment. There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years, in recent months, additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel by the PLO and other terrorist organizations.\\n\\nUltimately, the most serious terrorist threat is if one of those radical nations, who believe in terrorism as a policy, should have atomic weapons. Both I and all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons in countries like Libya or Iraq. We have even alienated some of our closest trade partners, because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries.\\n\\nWhen Governor Reagan has been asked about that, he makes a very disturbing comment that nonproliferation, or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons, is none of our business. And when he was asked specifically, recently, about Iraq, he said there\\'s nothing we can do about it.\\n\\nThis ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all, and it\\'s part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Ms. Walters, a followup?\\n\\nMS. WALTERS. Yes. While we are discussing policy, had Iran not taken American hostages, I assume that, in order to preserve our neutrality, we would have stopped the flow of spare parts and vital war materiels once war broke out between Iraq and Iran. Now, we\\'re offering to lift the ban on such goods if they let our people come home. Doesn\\'t this reward terrorism, compromise our neutrality, and possibly antagonize nations now friendly to us in the Middle East?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. We will maintain our position of neutrality in the Iran and Iraq war. We have no plans to sell additional materiel or goods to Iran that might be of a warlike nature. When I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result of the taking of our hostages, I announced then and have consistently maintained since then that if the hostages are released safely, that we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns, which they have bought and paid for-also, that the frozen Iranian assets would be released. That\\'s been a consistent policy, one I intend to carry out.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Would you repeat the question now for Governor Reagan, please, Ms. Walters?\\n\\nMs. WALTERS. Yes. Governor, the eyes of the country tonight remain on the hostages in Iran, but the question of how we respond to acts of terrorism goes beyond this current crisis. There are other countries that have policies that determine how they will respond. Israel, for example, considers hostages like soldiers and will not negotiate with terrorists.\\n\\nFor the future, the country has the right to know, do you have a policy for dealing with terrorism wherever it might happen, and what have we learned from this experience in Iran that might cause us to do things differently if this, or something similar, should happen again?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Well, Barbara, you\\'ve asked that question twice. I think you ought to have at least one answer to it. [Laughter]\\n\\nI have been accused lately of having a secret plan with regard to the hostages. Now, this comes from an answer that I\\'ve made at least 50 times during this campaign to the press. The question would be, \"Have you any ideas of what you would do if you were there?\" And I said, well, yes. And I think that anyone that\\'s seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, \"What about this, what about that?\" These are just ideas of what I would think of if I were in that position and had access to the information, in which I would know all the options that were open to me. I have never answered the question, however. Second — the one that says, \"Well, tell me, what are some of those ideas?\" First of all, I would be fearful that I might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations, and thus expose it and endanger the hostages. And sometimes, I think some of my ideas might involve quiet diplomacy, where you don\\'t say in advance or say to anyone what it is you\\'re thinking of doing.\\n\\nYour question is difficult to answer, because, in the situation right now, no one wants to say anything that would inadvertently delay, in any way, the return of those hostages if there is a chance of their coming home soon, or that might cause them harm.\\n\\nWhat I do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families and that tragedy is over — and we\\'ve endured this humiliation for just lacking 1 week of a year now — then, I think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they come home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about, what arrangements were made? And I would suggest that Congress should hold such an investigation.\\n\\nIn the meantime, I\\'m going to continue praying that they\\'ll come home.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Follow-up question.\\n\\nMs. WALTERS. Well, I would like to say that neither candidate answered specifically the question of a specific policy for dealing with terrorism, but I will ask Governor Reagan a different followup question. You have suggested that there would be no Iranian crisis had you been President, because we would have given firmer support to the Shah. But Iran is a country of 37 million people who were resisting a government they regarded as dictatorial.\\n\\nMy question is not whether the Shah\\'s regime was preferable to the Ayatollah\\'s, but whether the United States has the power or the right to try to determine what form of government any country will have, and do we back unpopular regimes whose major merit is that they are friendly to the United States?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. The degree of unpopularity of a regime when the choice is total authoritarianism — totalitarianism, I should say, in the alternative government, makes one wonder whether you are being helpful to the people. And we\\'ve been guilty of that. Because someone didn\\'t meet exactly our standards of human rights, even though they were an ally of ours, instead of trying patiently to persuade them to change their ways, we have, in a number of instances, aided a revolutionary overthrow which results in complete totalitarianism, instead, for those people. And I think that this is a kind of a hypocritical policy when, at the same time, we\\'re maintaining a detente with the one nation in the world where there are no human rights at all — the Soviet Union.\\n\\nNow, there was a second phase in the Iranian affair in which we had something to do with that. And that was, we had adequate warning that there was a threat to our Embassy, and we could have done what other Embassies did — either strengthen our security there or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover took place.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor, I\\'m sorry, I must interrupt. President Carter, you have a minute for rebuttal.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. I didn\\'t hear any comment from Governor Reagan about what he would do to stop or to reduce terrorism in the future. What the Western allies did decide to do is to stop all air flights-commercial air flights — to any nation involved in terrorism or the hijacking of airplanes, or the harboring of hijackers. Secondly, we all committed ourselves, as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office, not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives. Third, not to make any sales of materiel or weapons to a nation which is involved in terrorist activities. And, lastly, not to deal with the PLO until and unless the PLO recognizes Israel\\'s right to exist and recognizes U.N. Resolution 242 as a basis for a Middle East peace.\\n\\nThese are a few of the things to which our Nation is committed, and we will continue with these commitments.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan, you have the last word on that question.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes. I have no quarrel whatsoever with the things that have been done, because I believe it is high time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that there is no room worldwide for terrorism; there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind. And while I have a last word here, I would like to correct a misstatement of fact by the President. I have never made the statement that he suggested about nuclear proliferation, and nuclear proliferation, or the trying to halt it, would be a major part of a foreign policy of mine.\\n\\nMr. SMITH. Thank you, gentlemen. That is the first half of the debate.\\n\\nNow, the rules for the second half, quite simple. They\\'re only complicated when I explain them. [Laughter] In the second half, the panelists with me will have no followup questions. Instead, after the panelists have asked a question the candidates have answered, each of the candidates will have two opportunities to follow up, to question, to rebut, or just to comment on his opponent\\'s statement.\\n\\nGovernor Reagan will respond, in this section, to the first question from Marvin Stone.\\n\\nSTRATEGIC ARMS LIMITATION\\n\\nMr. STONE. Governor Reagan, arms control: The President said it was the single most important issue, Both of you have expressed the desire to end the nuclear arms race with Russia, but by methods that are vastly different. You suggest that we scrap the SALT II treaty, already negotiated, and intensify the buildup of American power to induce the Soviets to sign a new treaty, one more favorable to us.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes.\\n\\nMR. STONE. President Carter, on the other hand, says he will again try to convince a reluctant Congress to ratify the present treaty on the grounds it\\'s the best we can hope to get.\\n\\nNow, both of you cannot be right. Will you tell us why you think you are?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes. I think I\\'m right, because I believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy, a strong America, and a strong economy. And then, as we build up our national security, to restore our margin of safety, we at the same time try to restrain the Soviet buildup, which has been going forward at a rapid pace and for quite some time.\\n\\nThe SALT II treaty was the result of negotiations that Mr. Carter\\'s team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons, and his emissary, I think, came home in 12 hours having heard a very definite yet. But taking that one no from the Soviet Union, we then went back into negotiations on their terms, because Mr. Carter had canceled the B-1 bomber, delayed the MX, delayed the Trident submarine, delayed the cruise missile, shut down the Minuteman missile production line, and whatever other things that might have been done. The Soviet Union sat at the table knowing that we had gone forward with unilateral concessions without any reciprocation from them whatsoever.\\n\\nNow, I have not blocked the SALT II treaty, as Mr. Carter and Mr. Mondale suggest that I have. It has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority. Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with 7 abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States-besides which, it is illegal, because the law of the land, passed by Congress, says we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal. And we\\'re not equal in this treaty for one reason alone: Our B-52 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor, I have to interrupt you at that point. The time is up for that. But the same question now to President Carter.\\n\\nMR. STONE. Yes, President Carter. Both of you have expressed the desire to end the nuclear arms race with Russia, but through vastly different methods. The Governor suggests we scrap the SALT II treaty, which you signed in Vienna — intensify the buildup of American power to induce the Soviets to sign a new treaty, one more favorable to us. You, on the other hand, say you will again try to convince a reluctant Congress to ratify the present treaty on the grounds it is the best we can hope to get from the Russians.\\n\\nYou cannot both be right. Will you tell us why you think you are?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Yes, I\\'d be glad to. Inflation, unemployment, the cities-all very important issues, but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons. Every President who has served in the Oval Office since Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition of controlling nuclear weapons, to negotiate with the Soviet Union — balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry.\\n\\nThere is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan. He has never supported any of those arms control agreements — the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the antiballistic missile treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford — and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a 7-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors.\\n\\nThe Senate has not voted yet on the strategic arms limitation treaty. There have been preliminary skirmishings in the committees of the Senate, but the treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote. It\\'s understandable that a Senator in the preliminary debates can make an irresponsible statement, or, maybe, an ill-advised statement. You\\'ve got 99 other Senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake. But when a man who hopes to be President says, \"Take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation\" — that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan, you have an opportunity to rebut that.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes, I\\'d like to respond very much.\\n\\nFirst of all, the Soviet Union — if I have been critical of some of the previous agreements, it\\'s because we\\'ve been outnegotiated for quite a long time. And they have managed, in spite of all of our attempts at arms limitation, to go forward with the biggest military buildup in the history of man.\\n\\nNow, to suggest that because two Republican Presidents tried to pass the SALT treaty — that puts them on its side — I would like to say that President Ford, who was within 90 percent of a treaty that we could be in agreement with when he left office, is emphatically against this SALT treaty. I would like to point out also that Senators like Henry Jackson and Hollings of South Carolina — they are taking the lead in the fight against this particular treaty.\\n\\nI am not talking of scrapping; I am talking of taking the treaty back and going back into negotiations. And I would say to the Soviet Union, we will sit and negotiate with you as long as it takes, to have not only legitimate arms limitation but to have a reduction of these nuclear weapons to the point that neither one of us represents a threat to the other. That is hardly throwing away a treaty and being opposed to arms limitation.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. President Carter?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Yes. Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements. He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty — and I don\\'t know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form — but he also advocates the possibility-he said it\\'s been a missing element-of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race and insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own Nation as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union.\\n\\nIf President Brezhnev said, \"We will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American presidents over a 7-year period of time; we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations; and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations,\" it\\'s obvious that I, as President, and all Americans would reject such a proposition. This would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race.\\n\\nIt would be very disturbing to American people. It would change the basic tone and commitment that our Nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with all Presidents, Democratic and Republican, and would also be very disturbing to our allies, all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty. In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly.\\n\\nThis attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone, although it\\'s said with a quiet voice.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. I know the President\\'s supposed to be replying to me, but sometimes, I have a hard time in connecting what he\\'s saying with what I have said or what my positions are. I sometimes think he\\'s like the witch doctor that gets mad when a good doctor comes along with a cure that\\'ll work.\\n\\nMy point I have made already, Mr. President, with regard to negotiating. It does not call for nuclear superiority on the part of the United States; it calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other. And to suggest that the SALT II treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation, and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous Presidents, is just not true. It was a new negotiation, because, as I say, President Ford was within about 10 percent of having a solution that could be acceptable. And I think our allies would be very happy to go along with a fair and verifiable SALT agreement.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. President Carter, you have the last word on this question.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. I think, to close out this discussion, it would be better to put into perspective what we\\'re talking about.\\n\\nI had a discussion with my daughter, Amy, the other day, before I came here, to ask her what the most important issue was. She said she thought nuclear weaponry and the control of nuclear arms.\\n\\nThis is a formidable force. Some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion. If you put 50 tons of TNT in each one of railroad cars, you would have a trainload of TNT stretching across this Nation. That\\'s one major war explosion in a warhead. We have thousands, equivalent of megaton, or million tons, of TNT warheads. The control of these weapons is the single major responsibility of a President, and to cast out this commitment of all Presidents, because of some slight technicalities that can be corrected, is a very dangerous approach.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. We have to go to another question now, from Harry Ellis to President Carter.\\n\\nENERGY\\n\\nMR. ELLIS. Mr. President, as you have said, Americans, through conservation, are importing much less oil today than we were even a year ago. Yet U.S. dependence on Arab oil as a percentage of total imports is today much higher than it was at the time of the 1973 Arab oil embargo. And for some time to come, the loss of substantial amounts of Arab oil could plunge the U.S. into depression. Now, this means that a bridge must be built out of this dependence.\\n\\nCan the United States develop synthetic fuels and other alternative energy sources without damage to the environment, and will this process mean steadily higher fuel bills for American families?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. I don\\'t think there\\'s any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil is going to go up. What I\\'ve had as a basic commitment since I\\'ve been President is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil: It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy, to stop the waste of energy, and secondly, to produce more American energy.\\n\\nWe\\'ve been very successful in both cases. We\\'ve now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by onethird. We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same day just a year ago.\\n\\nThis commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our Nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the conventional kinds of American energy. We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history. We\\'ll produce more coal this year than any year in history. We\\'re exporting more coal this year than any year in history. And we have an opportunity now, with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on the world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source.\\n\\nThis exciting future will not only give us more energy security but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we\\'ve put into effect.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Would you repeat the question now for Governor Reagan?\\n\\nMR. ELLIS. Governor Reagan, Americans, through conservation, are importing much less oil today than we were even a year ago. And yet, U.S. reliance on Arab oil as a percentage of total imports is much higher today than it was during the 1973 Arab oil embargo. And the substantial loss of Arab oil could plunge the United States into depression.\\n\\nThe question is whether the development of alternative energy sources, in order to reduce this dependence, can be done without damaging the environment, and will it mean for American families steadily higher fuel bills?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. I\\'m not sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs, but I do believe that this Nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as being energy-poor when it is energy-rich. The coal that the President mentioned: Yes, we have it, and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now. The mines are closed down; there are 22,000 miners out of work. Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it. With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act. I think, as technology improves, we\\'ll be able to do even better with that.\\n\\nThe other thing is that we have only leased out and begun to explore 2 percent of our Outer Continental Shelf for oil, where it is believed by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy that there are vast supplies yet to be found. Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were — well, they were public lands subject to multiple-use exploration for minerals and so forth. It is believed that probably 70 percent of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there. This is particularly true of the recent efforts to shut down part of Alaska.\\n\\nNuclear power: There were 36 powerplants planned in this country — and let me add the word \"safety\"; it must be done with the utmost of safety. But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits and so forth make it take more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe.\\n\\nWe have the sources here. We are energy-rich, and coal is one of the great potentials we have.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. President Carter, your comment?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Yes, sir. To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which we\\'ll realize, to produce 800 million tons of coal — an unequaled record in the history of our country. Governor Reagan says that this is not a good achievement, and he blames restraints on coal production on regulations — regulations that affect the life and the health and safety of miners and also regulations that protect the purity of our air and the quality of our water and our land. We cannot cast aside those regulations. We have a chance in the next 15 years, insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines, and also preserving the same high air and water pollution standards, to triple the amount of coal we produce.\\n\\nGovernor Reagan\\'s approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal or to change substantially the windfall profits tax, to return a major portion of $227 billion back to the oil companies, to do away with the Department of Energy, to shortcircuit our synthetic fuels program, to put a minimal emphasis on solar power, to emphasize strongly nuclear powerplants as a major source of energy in the future. He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. That is a misstatement, of course, of my position. I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than Government can. The Department of Energy has a multibillion-dollar budget, in excess of $10 billion. It hasn\\'t produced a quart of oil or a lump of coal or anything else in the line of energy.\\n\\nAnd for Mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws and with the laws that pertain to clean water and clean air, and so forth as Governor of California, I took charge of passing the strictest air pollution laws in the United States — the strictest air quality law that has ever been adopted in the United States. And we created an OSHA, an occupational safety and health agency, for the protection of employees before the Federal Government had one in place. And to this day, not one of its decisions or rulings has ever been challenged.\\n\\nSo, I think some of those charges are missing the point. I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation. And I would like to see us a little more free, as we once were.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. President Carter, another crack at that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Sure. As a matter of fact, the air pollution standard laws that were passed in California were passed over the objections of Governor Reagan, and this is a very well known fact. Also, recently, when someone suggested that the Occupational Safety and Health Act should be abolished, Governor Reagan responded, \"Amen.\"\\n\\nThe offshore drilling rights is a question that Governor Reagan raises often. As a matter of fact, in the proposal for the Alaska lands legislation, 100 percent of all the offshore lands would be open for exploration, and 95 percent of all the Alaska lands where it is suspected or believed that minerals might exist. We have, with our 5-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954.\\n\\nSo, we\\'re not putting restraints on American exploration; we\\'re encouraging it in every way we can.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan, you have the last word on this question.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes. If it is a wellknown fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California — not a law, regulations that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations. It would have destroyed the economy of California, and, I must say, we had the support of Congress when pointed out how ridiculous this attempt was by the Environmental Protection Agency. We still have the strictest air control or air pollution laws in the country.\\n\\nAs for offshore oiling, only 2 percent now is so leased and is producing oil. The rest, as to whether the lands are going to be opened in the next 5 years or so — we\\'re already 5 years behind in what we should be doing. There is more oil now in the wells that have been drilled than has been taken out in the 121 years that they\\'ve been drilled.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Thank you, Governor.\\n\\nThank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nThe next question goes to Governor Reagan from William Hilliard.\\n\\nSOCIAL SECURITY\\n\\nMR. HILLIARD. Governor Reagan, wage earners in this country — especially the young — are supporting a social security system that continues to affect their income drastically. The system is fostering a struggle between the young and the old, and is drifting the country toward a polarization of these two groups. How much longer can the young wage earner expect to bear the ever-increasing burden of the social security system?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. The social security system was based on a false premise, with regard to how fast the number of workers would increase and how fast the number of retirees would increase. It is actuarially out of balance, and this first became evident about 16 years ago, and some of us were voicing warnings then. Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our Nation\\'s history, the payroll tax increase for social security, which will only put a Band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most.\\n\\nWhat is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on social security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check. We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens, leave them thinking that in some way they\\'re endangered and they would have no place to turn. They must continue to get those checks, and I believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis. But it\\'s going to take some study and some work, and not just passing a tax increase to let the roof fall in on the next administration.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Would you repeat that question for President Carter?\\n\\nMR. HILLIARD. Yes, President Carter. Wage earners in this country, especially the young, are supporting a social security system that continues to affect their income drastically. The system is fostering a struggle between young and old and is drifting the country toward a polarization of these two groups. How much longer can the young wage earner expect to bear the ever-increasing burden of the social security system?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. As long as there\\'s a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable social security system, free of the threat of bankruptcy. Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions he has advocated making social security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it. I noticed also in the Wall Street Journal earlier this week that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making social security more sound by reducing the adjustments in social security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation. These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security and the well-being, and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age.\\n\\nBut no matter what it takes in the future to keep social security sound, it must be kept that way. And although there was a serious threat to the social security system and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when I became President, the action of the Democratic Congress, working with me, has been to put social security back on a sound financial basis. That\\'s the way it will stay.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Well, that just isn\\'t true. It has, as I said, delayed the actuarial imbalance falling on us for just a few years with that increase in taxes. And I don\\'t believe we can go on increasing the tax, because the problem for the young people today is that they\\'re paying in far more than they can ever expect to get out.\\n\\nNow, again this statement that somehow I wanted to destroy it, and I just changed my tune, that I am for voluntary social security, which would mean the ruin of it. Mr. President, the voluntary thing that I suggested many years ago was that a young man, orphaned and raised by an aunt who died, his aunt was ineligible for social security insurance, because she was not his mother. And I suggested that if this is an insurance program, certainly the person who\\'s paying in should be able to name his own beneficiaries. And that\\'s the closest I\\'ve ever come to anything voluntary with social security. I, too, am pledged to a social security program that will reassure these senior citizens of ours they\\'re going to continue to get their money.\\n\\nThem are some changes I\\'d like to make. I would like to make a change that discriminates in the regulations against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her husband\\'s benefits, if he dies first, or what she has paid in; but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself, and she is entitled to more than she presently can get. I\\'d like to change that.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. President Carter\\'s rebuttal now.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Fine. These constant suggestions that the basic social security system should be changed does cause concern and consternation among the aged of our country. It\\'s obvious that we should have a commitment to them, that social security benefits should not be taxed, and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which social security payments are made to the retired people. We also need to continue to index the social security payments so that if inflation rises, the social security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of the social security check continue intact.\\n\\nIn the past, the relationship between social security and Medicare has been very important to provide some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits. Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this Nation against Medicare. Now we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease; an emphasis on outpatient care, not inpatient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care for those who are ill; an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it. These are the kind of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people. Governor Reagan, again, typically is against such a proposal.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. There you go again. [Laughter]\\n\\nWhen I opposed Medicare, there was another piece of legislation meeting the same problem before the Congress. I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed. I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them. I was opposing one piece of legislation as versus another.\\n\\nThere is something else about social security — of course, that doesn\\'t come out of the payroll tax; it comes out of the general fund — that something should be done about. I think it\\'s disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in social security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from social security every month while a State institution provides for all of their needs and their care.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. President Carter, you have the last word on this question.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. I think this debate on social security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies as vividly as any other subject tonight the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation. These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this Nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them.\\n\\nI noticed recently that Governor Reagan frequently quotes Democratic Presidents, in his acceptance address and otherwise. I have never heard a candidate for President, who is a Republican, quote a Republican President, but when they get in office, they try to govern like Republicans. So, its good for the American people to remember there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues-also, between the two parties that we represent.\\n\\nÂ MR. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. President, Governor Reagan.\\n\\nÂ We now go to another question, a question to President Carter by Barbara Walters.\\n\\nASSESSMENTS OF OPPONENT\\n\\nMS. WALTERS. Thank you.\\n\\nYou have addressed some of the major issues tonight, but the biggest issue in the minds of American voters is yourselves, your ability to lead this country. When many voters go into that booth just a week from today, they will be voting their gut instinct about you men.\\n\\nYou\\'ve already given us your reasons why people should vote for you. Now would you please tell us for this your final question, why they should not vote for your opponent, why his Presidency could be harmful to the Nation and, having examined both your opponent\\'s record and the man himself, tell us his greatest weakness.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question. [Laughter]\\n\\nFirst of all, there\\'s the historical perspective that I just described. This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I\\'ve taken in the Oval Office the last 4 years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others. The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations that don\\'t presently have it, particularly the terrorist nations.\\n\\nThe inclination that Governor Reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he\\'s been running for President — I think since 1968 — to inject American military forces in places like North Korea, to put a blockade around Cuba this year, or in some instances, to project American forces into a fishing dispute against the small nation of Ecuador on the west coast of South America — this is typical of his longstanding inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it.\\n\\nObviously, no President wants war, and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war. But a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way, in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Barbara, would you repeat the question for Governor Reagan?\\n\\nMS. WALTERS. Yes, thank you. Realizing that you may be equally reluctant to speak ill of your opponent, may I ask why people should not vote for your opponent, why his Presidency could be harmful to the Nation? And having examined both your opponent\\'s record and the man himself, could you tell us his greatest weakness?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Well, Barbara, I believe that there is a fundamental difference-and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight — that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program. I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers and autonomy and authority that belongs back at the State and local level — it has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people — and that there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves, if they were given a chance, or by the levels of government that were closer to them.\\n\\nNow, as to why I should be and he shouldn\\'t be, when he was a candidate in 1976, President Carter invented a thing he called the misery index. He added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation, and it came, at that time, to 12.5 under President Ford. And he said that no man with that size misery index had a right to seek reelection to the Presidency. Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20 percent, and I think this must suggest something.\\n\\nBut when I have quoted a Democrat President, as the President says, I was a Democrat. I said many foolish things back in those days. [Laughter] But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democrat promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept. And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today. And that\\'s why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept. It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. President Carter.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Yes. I mentioned the radical departure of Governor Reagan from the principles or ideals or historical perspective of his own party. I don\\'t think this can be better illustrated than in the case with guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our Nation. For 40 years, the Republican Party platforms called for guaranteeing women equal rights with a constitutional amendment. Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of women\\'s rights. Governor Reagan and the new Republican Party has departed from this commitment — a very severe blow to the opportunity for women finally to correct discrimination under which they have suffered.\\n\\nWhen a man and a woman do the same amount of work, a man gets paid a dollar; a woman only gets paid 59 cents. And the equal rights amendment only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for women by the Federal Government or by the State governments. That\\'s all it says — a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic Party and which is a very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagan\\'s radical departure from the longstanding policy of his own party.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes. Mr. President, once again, I happen to be against the amendment, because I think the amendment will take this problem out of the hands of elected legislators and put it in the hands of unelected judges. I am for equal rights, and while you have been in office for 4 years, and not one single State — and most of them have a majority of Democratic legislators has added to the ratification or voted to ratify the equal rights amendment.\\n\\nWhile I was Governor, more than 8 years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned, equal pay and so forth. I believe that if in all these years that we\\'ve spent trying to get the amendment, that we\\'d spent as much time correcting these laws, as we did in California — and we were the first to do it.\\n\\nIf I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment. I would have someone ride herd on those regulations, and we\\'d start eliminating those discriminations in the Federal Government against women.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. President Carter.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Yes. Howard, I\\'m a southerner, and I share the basic beliefs of my region about an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system. One of the commitments that I made was to deregulate the major industries of this country. We\\'ve been remarkably successful, with the help of the Democratic Congress. We\\'ve deregulated the air industry, the rail industry, the trucking industry, financial institutions; now working on the communications industry.\\n\\nIn addition to that, I believe this element of discrimination is something that the South has seen so vividly as a blight on our region of the country which has now been corrected — not only racial discrimination but discrimination against people that have to work for a living — because we have been trying to pick ourselves up by our bootstraps since the long Depression years and lead a full and useful life in the affairs of this country. We\\'ve made remarkable success. It\\'s part of my consciousness and of my commitment to continue this progress.\\n\\nSo, my heritage as a southerner, my experience in the Oval Office, convinces me that what I\\'ve just described is a proper course for the future.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan, yours is the last word.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Well, my last word is again to say that we were talking about this very simple amendment and women\\'s rights. And I make it plain again: I am for women\\'s rights. But I would like to call the attention of the people to the fact that so-called simple amendment could be used by mischievous men to destroy discriminations that properly belong, by law, to women, respecting the physical differences between the two sexes, labor laws that protect them against doing things that would be physically harmful to them. Those could all be challenged by men. And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth.\\n\\nI thought that was the subject we were supposed to be on. But, if we\\'re talking about how much we think about the working people and so forth, I\\'m the only fellow that ever ran for this job who was six times president of his own union and still has a lifetime membership in that union.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Gentlemen, each of you now have 3 minutes for a closing statement. President Carter, you\\'re first.\\n\\nCLOSING STATEMENTS\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. First of all, I\\'d like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible. I think it\\'s been a very constructive debate, and I hope it\\'s helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan. Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during this last few hours in my life.\\n\\nI\\'ve been President now for almost 4 years. I\\'ve had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process. I\\'ve seen the strength of my Nation, and I\\'ve seen the crises that it approached in a tentative way. And I\\'ve had to deal with those crises as best I could.\\n\\nAs I\\'ve studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, I\\'ve been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us. I think the results of this debate indicate that that fact is true. I consider myself in the mainstream of my party. I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who\\'ve served before me. The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure. We must have a society that\\'s just and fair. And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world.\\n\\nI believe that since I\\'ve been in office, there\\'ve been six or eight areas of combat evolve in other parts of the world. In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country. I\\'ve done that with moderation, with care, with thoughtfulness; sometimes consulting experts. But I\\'ve learned in this last 3 1/2 years that when an issue is extremely difficult, when the call is very close, the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50-50. And the final judgment about the future of our Nation — war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern — has to be made by the man in the Oval Office. It\\'s a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open government, the job is a very gratifying one.\\n\\nThe American people now are facing, next Tuesday, a lonely decision. Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country. And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference. If one vote per precinct had changed in 1960, John Kennedy would never have been President of this Nation. And if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President; Richard Nixon would not.\\n\\nThere is a partnership involved. And our Nation, to stay strong, to stay at peace, to raise high the banner of human rights, to set an example for the rest of the world, to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in all other nations is my plan for the future. I ask the American people to join me in this partnership.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes, I would like to add my words of thanks, too, to the ladies of the League of Women Voters for making these debates possible. I\\'m sorry that we couldn\\'t persuade the bringing in of the third candidate, so that he could have been seen also in these debates. But still, it\\'s good that at least once, all three of us were heard by the people of this country.\\n\\nNext Tuesday is election day. Next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls; you\\'ll stand there in the polling place and make a decision. I think when you make that decision, it might be well if you would ask yourself, are you better off than you were 4 years ago? Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was 4 years ago? Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was 4 years ago? Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we\\'re as strong as we were 4 years ago? And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to who you\\'ll vote for. If you don\\'t agree, if you don\\'t think that this course that we\\'ve been on for the last 4 years is what you would like to see us follow for the next 4, then I could suggest another choice that you have.\\n\\nThis country doesn\\'t have to be in the shape that it is in. We do not have to go on sharing in scarcity, with the country getting worse off, with unemployment growing. We talk about the unemployment lines. If all of the unemployed today were in a single line allowing 2 feet for each one of them, that line would reach from New York City to Los Angeles, California. All of this can be cured, and all of it can be solved.\\n\\nI have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous State in the Union if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world-I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make. I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this Nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today. I know because we did it there. We cut the cost — the increased cost of government-the increase in half over the 8 years. We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits, and cuts to our people. We, as I\\'ve said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that. And I know that we did give back authority and autonomy to the people.\\n\\nI would like to have a crusade today, and I would like to lead that crusade with your help. And it would be one to take government off the backs of the great people of this country and turn you loose again to do those things that I know you can do so well, because you did them and made this country great.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, for 60 years the League of Women Voters has been committed to citizen education and effective participation of Americans in governmental and political affairs. The most critical element of all in that process is an informed citizen who goes to the polls and who votes.\\n\\nOn behalf of the League of Women Voters, now, I would like to thank President Carter and Governor Reagan for being with us in Cleveland tonight. And, ladies and gentlemen, thank you and good night.'}]\n"
